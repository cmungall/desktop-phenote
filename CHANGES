Changes in latest release

1.8.7:
- Improved protocol for updating ontology files from repository.
In many cases, these ontology files don't have a date (though I think
they all should have a date or a version), and in the past, these were
updated (wastefully) every time Phenote started up.  Now it checks
whether your local version is less than six days old, and if it is, then
it doesn't update from the repository.  (If you know there was a recent
update that you want, you can of course always update your local copy
by hand.)
This should save a lot of time on startup--in particular, we can avoid
unnecessarily downloading omim.obo every time!
- Date Created field is now visible (in human-annotation.cfg--visibility
is controlled in the config file) but not editable (you can try to change it
but it goes back to what it was).
- Date Created is automatically filled in for newly-created annotations
(it's round-tripped for existing ones).  Fixes bug
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3389282&group_id=76834&atid=887913
- Heiko improved the installer so that if you have a 64-bit computer with
64-bit Java, the installer will install Phenote so that it will launch in
64-bit mode.  The installer tries to detect if you have a 64-bit machine, in
which case it suggests a larger memory allocation, but it is (by necessity)
conservative about this (because if it suggested a too-high memory setting you
wouldn't be able to launch OE at all), so it may limit you to an 1860M
setting. If this happens, you can hand-edit Phenote.vmoptions and put a
higher memory setting (up to the amount of physical memory on your computer),
and then relaunch OE (twice, if you're on a Mac).

Changes in earlier releases
=================

Changes in versions 1.7-beta1-5:
- Phenote+ is now just called Phenote.  The old Phenote will be de-supported.
- Added support for proxies.  Users can now set proxy via a GUI.  All
ontology-fetching, date-checking, etc. will then be done via the proxy that is
set.  Proxy setting saved in user's config.xml.
- Fixed Help/User Guide (wasn't working at all) in standalone version.
(Still problematic in webstart.)
- Improved About.
- Fixed Apple->Exit (was doing nothing)
- When you ran Phenote for the first time from the installed version, it would
let you choose your config and then would show nothing at all for several minutes
while it downloads the ontology files.  Now it at least pops up a dialog box
that says "Updating ontology files--please wait".  Unfortunately, I can't get
it to put anything inside the dialog box until it's done downloading the
ontology files (by which point it's pointless), but at least it now shows
SOMETHING so that new Phenote users don't think it's crashed.
- Fixed some out-of-date stuff in some config files (e.g. plant.cfg)
- Made "Date created" field show up in Annotation Table for
  zfin-standalone.cfg (at request of ZFIN curator David Fashena).

1.7-beta6:
- If we fail to get a new copy of the config file from the repository,
  just use the local copy--don't give up and use the flybase config.
- Phenote title bar now shows name of last file loaded (or saved).

1.7-beta7:
Fixed save bug (introduced around 1.7-beta2)

1.7-beta8: 
- Greatly improved startup speed by loading each ontology once, rather than
multiple times, in OntologyDataAdapter.mapNamespacesToOntologies
- European-style dates in input (e.g., "20.10.2009") could not be parsed, and
thus were lost and not saved in the output.
Phenote can now handle THAT SPECIFIC DATE FORMAT (dd.MM.yyyy) as well as the
default SimpleDateFormat.  Any other date format will still fail.

1.7-beta9:
- In 1.7-beta6, we enabled Phenote to use the config file in .phenote if it
couldn't update it from the master repository.  This version adds similar
robustness for the ontology files: if Phenote can't get new ones from the
repository for some reason, it just uses the local copies.
- Updated help pages and website

1.7-beta10:
This verison of Phenote can run offline, even if you're launching it for the
first time.  Now it can get the config out of the jar (not just from your
.phenote).

1.7-beta11:
- Fixed bug 2972252: When you save, if Phenote has any issues with your data
(e.g., missing field), it pops up a dialog showing the errors and asking you
if you still want to save.  After you click "Yes", you get the same dialog
again and have to click "Yes" again.  (Now you get the dialog only once.)
- Fixed bug 2970581: updating files message displayed when no updating set
(by making the "please wait" message more general)
- Fixed bug 2975530: 
If you change some data and try to quit, Phenote will warn you that you've
made changes and ask if you want to save. However, if you make changes and
then load a new file, it wasn't warning you, and would lose any changes you
had made.  (Now it will warn.)
- Fixed bug 2970568: Term info browser fails to sync with other components
properly when browsing by clicking parent or child terms.  (Now OE components
like Graph Editor change to show selected term when we follow hyperlinks to
parent or child terms in the Term Info browser.)
- Fixed bug 986638:  Term info browser doesn't show current term unless you
edit.  (Now you can double-click a term in the annotation table and the term info
browser AND any open OBO-Edit components such as the Graph Editor will change
to show that term!  Before, you had to edit the term and get a dropdown
completion list and pick something from it before you could convince the Term
Info and other windows to show the term.)
- Fixed bug 2982845: Green checkmark in Term Info doesn't work at first.

1.7-beta12
- Fixed bug 2993230: terms used in annotations that are not in any currently
loaded ontology were getting lost.
Sandra is modifying an ontology (human_phenotype.obo) and wants to use her new
terms to annotate before the terms have made it into the cvs repository.
However, if she used new terms in her annotation files, and then one of her
collaborators opened her annotations without having her updated
human_phenotype.obo file, the new annotation terms didn't show up in the
display and were lost if the collaborator saved the data.
Now these unknown terms are not lost, and they are visually indicated in the
Term Info window with an orange bar that says "UNKNOWN TERM".
- Fixed bug 2990121: restored gridlines in tables (on Mac with JDK 1.6).

1.7-beta13
- Changes to zfin configs to fix problems reported by Ceri Van Slyke.

1.7-beta14
- Partial fix (improvement, at least) for several related bug reports:
  - 3013449--Can't delete ontology-constrained terms in Annotation Editor
  - 1850306--cell contents disappear in row selection
  - 2972788--Field edits sometimes get lost unless you hit enter
  - 1874953--multi select wipes out data

The failure to commit changes made in annotation-constrained fields in the
Annotation Editor mostly happened if, rather than hitting return in the newly
empty field, you hit tab (to go to the next field) or clicked on something
else. (However, it didn't reliably happen even then--sometimes it worked
fine.)  I noticed the behavior the most when selecting multiple rows, and then
clicking on the field in the Annot Editor to empty it, and hitting tab.
Usually, the terms were not deleted as desired (but sometimes they were!).

I have improved the behavior somewhat by checking TermCompLists (these
annotation-constrained fields) for focusLost (i.e., user tabbed or clicked out
of the field--these weren't registering as KeyEvents) and not just for return,
but it still sometimes seems not to do the right thing.

- New Phenote logo
- New splah screen (bePatientDialog) that stays up while Phenote is loading
(well, actually, it still seems to show up blank when you run the installed
version, though it looks fine when you launch Phenote from the shell).

1.7-beta15
- Fixed bug 3017776--Config files auto-update even if they have when="NEVER"
- Added info about command-line options to user guide
- Added name of current config to splash screen (should it also be added to
the About screen?)
- Fixed updating of user-selected ontology files.  Fixes these bugs:
  - "Ontology Update" dialog ignoring choices - ID: 2925894
  - update ontologies update button misleading message - ID: 2950774
- Fixed bug 3019278 (-f command-line option (for specifying a file to load)
doesn't work).  You can now specify an annotation file on the command line,
e.g.,
        phenote -f data/mydatafile.tab
- Added user guide page about using filters
- Made Annotation Editor hold 8 fields per tab instead of 10 because 10 didn't
fit.  (Also made panel a bit bigger, because even 8 fields weren't always
fitting.)
- (Chris refactored OboUtil because Phenote was trying to call setID in obo,
which didn't have public access.  Now static helper classes are retained in
OboUtil.  This shouldn't affect any Phenote behavior; I'm just noting it down
for future reference.)

1.7-beta16
- Better recovery from problems with config files (for example, when
auto-update doesn't work, like last week, when SourceForge wasn't working
right).  If auto-updated config file doesn't work, Phenote now tries to find
its own cached copy of the config file and uses that instead.  (It no longer
changes your configuration to Flybase.)  If all attempts fail, it pops up an
error window explaining that the user's selected configuration is no good, and
prompts them to choose a new configuration.
- Better error messages when there's something wrong with one of the ontology
files Phenote uses.
- User guide now explains how to find your .phenote directory on Windows.

1.7-beta17
- Made tabs in Annotation Editor configurable in two ways:
1. Ability to designate number of fields per tab
2. Ability to name tabs and assign fields to named tabs
Both are specified in the config file.  For specifying the number of
fields per tab, use the fields-per-tab attribute:
<fields-per-tab numfields="12"/>
For naming tabs, simply add tab="TabName" to each <field>.   You can have
as many different tab names as you want.  If you specify tab names, the
fields-per-tab attribute (which normally defaults to 8) is ignored.

1.7-beta18
- Added ability to search dbxrefs during term autocompletion.
Whether or not to search dbxrefs is configurable from menu and config file,
just like other options (name, synonym, etc.).

1.8.1 (we don't really need to keeeep calling them beta, do we?)
- If a field has a description (desc) defined in the configuration, it will now
pop up  as a tooltip if you hover your mouse over the field name in the
Annotation Editor.
- Better notification about fatal errors (a popup error report appears).

1.8.2-3
1.8.2 and 1.8.3 are essentially the same as 1.8.1. The only changes are that
some configuration and ontology files have been updated, and 1.8.3 now
explicitly requires you to have Java 1.6 installed.

1.8.4 (18 Nov 2010):
- Graph View bug fixed (in OBO-Edit)--was showing only immediate parent(s),
now shows whole tree.
- Fixed problem finding obo files in jar (broken between 1.7-beta16 and
1.7-beta17). (SF #3110957)
- Term Info panel layout improvements:
  - Made fonts match (SF #3110973)
  - Stopped term name from floating
  - Left more space for relationships in Parent/Child panel (SF #3110975)
- If there's no .phenote and Phenote can't create it (this was
  happening to me when I ran the Windows emulator), it now pops up a
  dialog box and then exits.
- Improved appearance of config chooser on Windows.
- Phenote logo is now appearing properly on "please wait" splash screen on Windows.
- To help debug Sandra's problem, it now prints the first 10 lines of each
ontology file to the log.  (Can turn this off when that problem is resolved.)

1.8.5 (internal release, 1 Feb 2011):
- If you load a data file that has column(s) that are not defined in the
current config, any values in those columns will be lost if you save the
data.  Phenote was inconspiciously printing an error message.  Now it brings
up a popup that warns the user about unknown columns.
- The Date Created column was silently added by Phenote, even if it wasn't in
the configuration, but it was not round-tripped if it wasn't in the
configuration.  I have now added "Date Created" to most of the configurations
that I believe to be in active use (and set isVisible="false" so the user
won't be able to see/edit this field).
- Fixed typo in phenote shell script that allocated too much memory to
Phenote.  (This only affected users who were launching Phenote from the
command line rather than from the application icon.)
- Added more documentation to web pages and userguide about how to
compile and run Phenote from the command line

1.8.6 (10 Feb 2011):
- Made release Java-1.5-compatible for users who have older Macs
- Changed ontology URLs from old SourceForge cvs ones (which no longer work)
to purl.org.  Note that the human phenotype ontology files are now called
HP.obo and HP_XP.obo rather than human_phenotype.obo and
human_phenotype_xp.obo; however, Sandra's local file is still called
human_phenotype.obo.  Let me know if you want to change that.
