Changes in versions 1.7-beta1-3:
- Phenote+ is now just called Phenote.  The old Phenote will be de-supported.
- Added support for proxies.  Users can now set proxy via a GUI.  All
ontology-fetching, date-checking, etc. will then be done via the proxy that is
set.  Proxy setting saved in user's config.xml.
- Fixed Help/User Guide (wasn't working at all) in standalone version.
(Still problematic in webstart.)
- Improved About.
- Fixed Apple->Exit (was doing nothing)
- When you ran Phenote for the first time from the installed version, it would
let you choose your config and then shows nothing at all for several minutes
while it downloads the ontology files.  Now it at least pops up a dialog box
that says "Updating ontology files--please wait".  Unfortunately, I can't get
it to put anything inside the dialog box until it's done downloading the
ontology files (by which point it's pointless), but at least it now shows
SOMETHING so that new Phenote users don't think it's crashed.
- Fixed some out-of-date stuff in some config files (e.g. plant.cfg)
- Made "Date created" field show up in Annotation Table for
  zfin-standalone.cfg (at request of ZFIN curator David Fashena).
- Title bar now shows name of last file loaded (or saved).

1.7-beta7: Fixed save bug (introduced around 1.7-beta2)
1.7-beta8: 
- Greatly improved startup speed by loading each ontology once, rather than
multiple times, in OntologyDataAdapter.mapNamespacesToOntologies
- Europen-style dates in input (e.g., "20.10.2009") could not be parsed, and
thus were lost and not saved in the output.
Phenote can now handle THAT SPECIFIC DATE FORMAT (dd.MM.yyyy) as well as the
default SimpleDateFormat.  Any other date format will still fail.  Note that
if you save, the date will be saved in SimpleDateFormat default format ("Oct
20, 2009"), not in the original input format ("20.10.2009").
