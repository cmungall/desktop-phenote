Changes in versions 1.7-beta1-5:
- Phenote+ is now just called Phenote.  The old Phenote will be de-supported.
- Added support for proxies.  Users can now set proxy via a GUI.  All
ontology-fetching, date-checking, etc. will then be done via the proxy that is
set.  Proxy setting saved in user's config.xml.
- Fixed Help/User Guide (wasn't working at all) in standalone version.
(Still problematic in webstart.)
- Improved About.
- Fixed Apple->Exit (was doing nothing)
- When you ran Phenote for the first time from the installed version, it would
let you choose your config and then would show nothing at all for several minutes
while it downloads the ontology files.  Now it at least pops up a dialog box
that says "Updating ontology files--please wait".  Unfortunately, I can't get
it to put anything inside the dialog box until it's done downloading the
ontology files (by which point it's pointless), but at least it now shows
SOMETHING so that new Phenote users don't think it's crashed.
- Fixed some out-of-date stuff in some config files (e.g. plant.cfg)
- Made "Date created" field show up in Annotation Table for
  zfin-standalone.cfg (at request of ZFIN curator David Fashena).

1.7-beta6:
- If we fail to get a new copy of the config file from the repository,
  just use the local copy--don't give up and use the flybase config.
- Phenote title bar now shows name of last file loaded (or saved).

1.7-beta7:
Fixed save bug (introduced around 1.7-beta2)

1.7-beta8: 
- Greatly improved startup speed by loading each ontology once, rather than
multiple times, in OntologyDataAdapter.mapNamespacesToOntologies
- Europen-style dates in input (e.g., "20.10.2009") could not be parsed, and
thus were lost and not saved in the output.
Phenote can now handle THAT SPECIFIC DATE FORMAT (dd.MM.yyyy) as well as the
default SimpleDateFormat.  Any other date format will still fail.

1.7-beta9:
- In 1.7-beta6, we enabled Phenote to use the config file in .phenote if it
couldn't update it from the master repository.  This version adds similar
robustness for the ontology files: if Phenote can't get new ones from the
repository for some reason, it just uses the local copies.
- Updated help pages and website

1.7-beta10:
This verison of Phenote can run offline, even if you're launching it for the
first time.  Now it can get the config out of the jar (not just from your
.phenote).

1.7-beta11:
- Fixed bug 2972252: When you save, if Phenote has any issues with your data
(e.g., missing field), it pops up a dialog showing the errors and asking you
if you still want to save.  After you click "Yes", you get the same dialog
again and have to click "Yes" again.  (Now you get the dialog only once.)
- Fixed bug 2970581: updating files message displayed when no updating set
(by making the "please wait" message more general)
- Fixed bug 2975530: 
If you change some data and try to quit, Phenote will warn you that you've
made changes and ask if you want to save. However, if you make changes and
then load a new file, it wasn't warning you, and would lose any changes you
had made.  (Now it will warn.)
- Fixed bug 2970568: Term info browser fails to sync with other components
properly when browsing by clicking parent or child terms.  (Now OE components
like Graph Editor change to show selected term when we follow hyperlinks to
parent or child terms in the Term Info browser.)
- Fixed bug 986638:  Term info browser doesn't show current term unless you
edit.  (Now you can double-click a term in the annotation table and the term info
browser AND any open OBO-Edit components such as the Graph Editor will change
to show that term!  Before, you had to edit the term and get a dropdown
completion list and pick something from it before you could convince the Term
Info and other windows to show the term.)
- Fixed bug 2982845: Green checkmark in Term Info doesn't work at first.

1.7-beta12
- Fixed bug 2993230: terms used in annotations that are not in any currently
loaded ontology were getting lost.
Sandra is modifying an ontology (human_phenotype.obo) and wants to use her new
terms to annotate before the terms have made it into the cvs repository.
However, if she used new terms in her annotation files, and then one of her
collaborators opened her annotations without having her updated
human_phenotype.obo file, the new annotation terms didn't show up in the
display and were lost if the collaborator saved the data.
Now these unknown terms are not lost, and they are visually indicated in the
Term Info window with an orange bar that says "UNKNOWN TERM".
- Fixed bug 2990121: restored gridlines in tables (on Mac with JDK 1.6).

1.7-beta13
- Changes to zfin configs to fix problems reported by Ceri Van Slyke.

1.7-beta14
- Partial fix (improvement, at least) for several related bug reports:
  - 3013449--Can't delete ontology-constrained terms in Annotation Editor
  - 1850306--cell contents disappear in row selection
  - 2972788--Field edits sometimes get lost unless you hit enter
  - 1874953--multi select wipes out data

The failure to commit changes made in annotation-constrained fields in the
Annotation Editor mostly happened if, rather than hitting return in the newly
empty field, you hit tab (to go to the next field) or clicked on something
else. (However, it didn't reliably happen even then--sometimes it worked
fine.)  I noticed the behavior the most when selecting multiple rows, and then
clicking on the field in the Annot Editor to empty it, and hitting tab.
Usually, the terms were not deleted as desired (but sometimes they were!).

I have improved the behavior somewhat by checking TermCompLists (these
annotation-constrained fields) for focusLost (i.e., user tabbed or clicked out
of the field--these weren't registering as KeyEvents) and not just for return,
but it still sometimes seems not to do the right thing.

- New Phenote logo
- New splah screen (bePatientDialog) that stays up while Phenote is loading
(well, actually, it still seems to show up blank when you run the installed
version, though it looks fine when you launch Phenote from the shell).

1.7-beta15
- Fixed bug 3017776--Config files auto-update even if they have when="NEVER"
- Added info about command-line options to user guide
- Added name of current config to splash screen (should it also be added to
the About screen?)
- Fixed updating of user-selected ontology files.  Fixes these bugs:
  - "Ontology Update" dialog ignoring choices - ID: 2925894
  - update ontologies update button misleading message - ID: 2950774
- Fixed bug 3019278 (-f command-line option (for specifying a file to load)
doesn't work).  You can now specify an annotation file on the command line,
e.g.,
        phenote -f data/mydatafile.tab
- Added user guide page about using filters
- Made Annotation Editor hold 8 fields per tab instead of 10 because 10 didn't
fit.  (Also made panel a bit bigger, because even 8 fields weren't always
fitting.)
- (Chris refactored OboUtil because Phenote was trying to call setID in obo,
which didn't have public access.  Now static helper classes are retained in
OboUtil.  This shouldn't affect any Phenote behavior; I'm just noting it down
for future reference.)
