<h2>Making a Phenote release</h2>
<br>
-&nbsp;commit everything, check with other developers, compile all, TEST...<br>
<br>
- modify docs/phenote-website/phenote.jnlp file<br>
ant will automatically put in new version of phenote (thanks jim)<br>
need to add any new jar files to jar list (eventually will automate with ant?)<br>
also update any specialized jnlpl files (eg smart-atlas.jnlp)<br>
<br>
- edit docs/phenote-website/phenote-release-notes.html<br>
with all the new features and bug fixes<br>
this could even be added to as you fix things during the release cycle. <br>
this page is used by the phenote website<br>
<br>
[phenote.html is being phased out so not critical to update]<br>
<br>
-&nbsp;svn checkout on web machine (or a machine that is networked with
it - maybe this is so of your machine already - not always the case) <br>
<br>
- make sure you have a jar signer that will be needed for signing the
jars for webstart. if you dont you need to make one [fill in details of
making a key for jar signing]<br>
<br>
- make a symbolic link (if you dont already have one) from your phenote
root to the root of your web where phenote will be plopped - and call
it "phenote-webstart". This will be used by ant<br>
make sure you have write permission to this directory and permission to mkdird<br>
<br>
- set "hardwiredDefaultVersion" in PhenoteVersion.java to the current version of phenote
<br>
(this is no longer true - but we may bring this back) [- set
environment variable PHENOTE_VERSION to the current version of phenote,
e.g. "1.5". ant will deploy phenote to
phenote-webstart/${PHENOTE_VERSION}]<br>
<br>
- ant webstart -Dphenote.version="versionNumber" (called from phenote root) should then install phenote webstart<br>
version number is something like "1.5"<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>update the release notes:
  <p> in phenote/doc/phenote-website there's a file called phenote-release-notes.shtml.  add any significant changes, bugfixes, or new features.  i try to put the most interesting (for the user) changes first, since they might read this to see what's new, but might stop reading after only a few.  When applicable, be sure to include a link to the tracker item that the item relates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>update the links on the website:
  <ul>
    <li>index.shtml:
    <p>there's a 'quick link' - change to the latest version</p>
    <p>add a note that there's been a new release to the 'news' section</p>
    <p>remove the oldest release news item</p></li>
    <li>events.shtml:
    <p>add the same news item to this page (past events section)</p>
    </li>
    <li>download.shtml:
    <p>update the link to the newest release under webstart </p>
    <p>update the svn command under 'run phenote at the command   line'</p>
    <p>add the latest and/or sexiest features of the latest release</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>to update the website:
  <p>then, to make sure all the changes are made to the website, be sure to first commit your changes to svn.  then run 'update_site' script that resides in the phenote/website dir.  this must be done from a berkeleybop machine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
- make tag in sourceforge subversion
