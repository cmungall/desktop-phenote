<h2>Making a Phenote release</h2>
<br>
-&nbsp;commit everything, check with other developers, compile all, TEST...<br>
<br>
- modify docs/phenote-website/phenote.jnlp file<br>
ant will automatically put in new version of phenote (thanks jim)<br>
need to add any new jar files to jar list (eventually will automate with ant?)<br>
also update any specialized jnlpl files (eg smart-atlas.jnlp)<br>
<br>
- edit docs/phenote-website/phenote-release-notes.html<br>
with all the new features and bug fixes<br>
this could even be added to as you fix things during the release cycle. <br>
this page is used by the phenote website<br>
<br>
[phenote.html is being phased out so not critical to update]<br>
<br>
-&nbsp;svn checkout on web machine (or a machine that is networked with
it - maybe this is so of your machine already - not always the case) <br>
<br>
- make sure you have a jar signer that will be needed for signing the
jars for webstart. if you dont you need to make one [fill in details of
making a key for jar signing]<br>
<br>
- make a symbolic link (if you dont already have one) from your phenote
root to the root of your web where phenote will be plopped - and call
it "phenote-webstart". This will be used by ant<br>
make sure you have write permission to this directory and permission to mkdird<br>
<br>
- set "hardwiredDefaultVersion" in PhenoteVersion.java to the current version of phenote
<br>
(this is no longer true - but we may bring this back) [- set
environment variable PHENOTE_VERSION to the current version of phenote,
e.g. "1.5". ant will deploy phenote to
phenote-webstart/${PHENOTE_VERSION}]<br>
<br>
- ant webstart -Dphenote.version="versionNumber" (called from phenote root) should then install phenote webstart<br>
version number is something like "1.5"<br>
<br>
- [Nicole then modifies some files and runs some script to update the
phenote website download page - nicole could you fill that in here? ]<br>
<br>
- make tag in sourceforge subversion
