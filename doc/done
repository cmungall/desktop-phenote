#filter out attributes from pato ontology - or filter in *Value

#BUG with 1 backspace completion doesnt complete
-- i give up on making a test - simulating backspace seems to be a humdinger
--- coulda done with AutoTextField - woops next time
-- this seems to be a 1.5 bug - as doesnt happen in 1.4 jbuilder - 
- nor when compile & rin with 1.4

#yikes - nothing going into field on comp list selection!

#exception on selecting item from list - subsequent selections dont put text in field
yikes! - this is probably how release is!
-- also doesnt go in table
-- not specific to 1.5 - also in 1.4 (jbuilder)

#BUG -- make test for this
-- this is a 1.5 bug - probably related to delete bug below - fix delete bug 1st
if you enter x (entity)
then click pharynx
then backspace on "nx"
then select any other term - pharyngoid for instance get null pointer
which says that comboBox.getText is returning null in

#put children relations in term info
#put term info in scroller.
#do layout of term info better in phenote - grid bag layout?
#put border with "Term Information" title around term info
#put def at end?
#popup staying up after selection - annoying! didnt use to


obsolete button should be "include obsoletes" - search obsoletes in
addition to non-obsoletes - currently its obsoletes only
- should we have a mode for searching obs & no non-obs - probably not

alphabeticize comp list - presort?

alphabeticizing has prompted a refactor - 
CompletionList should be renamed Ontology - its not a completion list
which is a subset of terms that match input - its all the terms in the
ontology - obs & non obs - & sorted
also AutoComboBox should have an Ontology - 
and there should be one Ontology object for each ontology - rather
than one CompletionList singleton for all ontologies
geez - it seems so obvious now

#TermInfo should be a JEditorPane - then do formatting with html - bold! but
have to then put in line breaks - no word wrapping. apparently there
is word wrapping
#-capitalize stages/catch-alls
#- new line between things?

for 0.4 4/27/06

genetic context field added
-- much reafctoring  for new field/configuration

MVC put in place 
event listener for CharChange
selection manager event listener
MVC!!!
view table
view fields
model phenotype
table,fields modify model -> controller? sends out model changed event
 -> views (table,field) update themselves 
fields & table dont need to talk to each other - just views on model!
actually its utterly simple - on gt editing or ACB choosing send out
event - table just merely updates its view - just does a
refresh/resycnch with pheno data - no need to update column do whole
table - need to be sure it maintains old selection 
should there be a PatoComboBox & EntityCB that know how to modify model?
or is that overkill? alternative is if statements on ontology string/enum

similarly need to selection event listener

also could put in hypoer links into jeditor pane to ontology terms
- could the text be selectable so it would then go to that term both
term info and possibly the completion box? (check box for comp box to
follow selection?) - not sure how possible that would be - support in
text area? for mouse over text? would be cool!
or could be done with link that https to self as servlet - kinda silly
but would work - but would then lose ability to link out to outside
world - well just have 2 links - internal select - web select

#- also some defs have http links in them - make them clickable! automatic
BrowserLauncher2 goes to konqueror on linux - either find how to change linux setting
and/or put in override like apollo does

- but i dont think this works for webstart app - test - see apollos
  webstart web launch stuff

test suite not working!

bug - search on jaw synonym - get repeated terms + TEST

ant run

#email question - should synonoyms that are exact matches be first in
comp list like term exact matches are? - melissa says yes

make configurable for anatomy obo - cmd line?, xml config? menu?
also lump ontology - taxonomy

have to put config file in jar for webstart 

have command line param for which config file to use! 1st cut dont
need whole command line package

#refactor - Phenotype -> Character

1.5? yes - jbuilder

put syns in brackets in completion list? NO - melissa nixed
- this will complicate as no longer can do OBOClass.toString for
completion list - the completion list will no longer be able to be obo
classes - would have to map between obo classes and completion list -
parse out term name and look for term in obo session? or cached list
of obo classes - or keep cached list in same order as string term-syn
list? curious to get feedback from curators before jumping into this
complication - is term info enough for syns?

if user deletes last row bring up blank row - dont allow 0 rows
