<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Editing the model</span></h3>
So a phenote.edit.CharChangeEvent has a phenote.edit.TransactionI. <br>
so when a gui component like CharFieldGui wants to edit the model&nbsp;
it calls a method on the EditManager. For instance, for updating
multiple fields at once CharFieldGui makes a bunch of
UpdateTransactions adds them to a CompoundTransaction and sends the
CompoundTransaction to EditManager.updateModel(). updateModel calls
editModel() on the CompoundTransaction (which actually edits the
model),
make a CharChangeEvent with the transaction and sends out the
CharChangeEvent out to CharChangeListeners notifying them that the
model has been changed, and adds the transaction to its list of
transactions (for undo).<br>
A phenote.edit.TransactionI knows how to edit and undo its edit to the datamodel.
