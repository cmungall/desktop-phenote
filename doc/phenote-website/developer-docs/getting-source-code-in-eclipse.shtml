        Getting and Running the Source Code
      </div>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This page provides instructions for downloading the Phenote source code, compiling, and running the software from either the command line or through Eclipse, and is primarily intended for developers.</p>

      <h1>Getting the Source Code from Subversion on the command line</h1>
      <p>Phenote is stored in
      a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">subversion</a>
      repository
      at <a href="http://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/phenote/trunk/">SourceForge</a>.  To check out the Phenote code, type this on your command line:
      <p><code>svn co https://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obo/phenote/trunk phenote</code></p>
      <p>If you want to check out the supporting projects, you can do that as follows:<br>
          <code>svn co https://geneontology.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geneontology/java/bbop/trunk BBOP</code><br>
            <code>svn co https://geneontology.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geneontology/java/obo/trunk OBO</code><br>
              <code>svn co https://geneontology.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geneontology/java/oboedit/trunk OBO-Edit</code><br>
                <p>However, it is not necessary to check out these projects, as the relevant jars are included in the Phenote distribution.</p>
      <p>You should update the source code periodically, as it changes frequently.  You can do that with the <code>svn update</code> command.</p>

      <h1>Compiling and running Phenote from the command line</h1>
      <p>You will need to have <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Apache ant</a> installed on your system.</p>
      <p>After you've downloaded the source code, build the project with the command <code>ant build-all</code></p>
      <p>Then run the "phenote" shell script to launch Phenote.</p>

      <h1>Browsing the Phenote source on SourceForge</h1>
      <P>If you go
      to <a href="http://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/phenote/trunk/">http://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/phenote/trunk/</a>,
      you can browse the Phenote source code and examine the change history.</p>
     
      <h1>Getting the Source Code with Eclipse</h1>
      <h2>Build Paths</h2>
        <p>The Phenote Eclipse project is designed to be used with the OBO and BBOP Java APIs.  The build path in the Phenote project file refers to projects named "OBO", "BBOP", and "OBO-Edit" as dependencies, so it is highly recommended that you follow the optional instructions below to create these projects as well.</p>
      <p>However, checking out these other projects is not required.  If you prefer, you may check out only the Phenote project, remove the project dependencies, and modify the build path to include jars/bbop.jar, jars/obo.jar, and jars/oboedit.jar.</p>
      
      <h2>Installing Subversion Support</h2>
      <p>Current versions of Eclipse do not automatically support subversion. However, the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">subclipse plugin</a> adds seamless subversion support to Eclipse, using the existing Team mechanisms. See <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html">http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html</a> for installation instructions.</p>

      <h2>Updating the source code via subclipse</h2>
      <ol>
	<li>The source code for these projects is updated periodically.  You have to update manually; Eclipse will not do this automatically.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the project name (e.g. Phenote) in the Package Explorer and choose Team->Update from the menu</li>
        <li>When the update is complete, right-click on the project name again and choose Refresh</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Running Phenote from Eclipse</h1>
      <p>When you run Phenote, you need to assign the amount of memory it will use. To do so, select "Open Run Dialog" from the Run menu. Make sure Phenote is selected in the "Java Application" list on the left. Then fill in the following parameter in the VM arguments box according to the amount of memory in your computer:  (1024M is recommended.)</p>

         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <p>You may also need to set the jars that Phenote uses. From the list of projects in the Package Explorer, choose Phenote, then right-click and select "Properties". In the Properties window, select "Java Build Path" from the list on the left side, and then choose the "Libraries" tab. Click "Add JARs" and add the jars in Phenote/jars.</p>
      <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-phenote-jars.png"
         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <p>You will also need to set up the test suite as a separate source tree:</p>
            <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-phenote-source.png"
         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <p>If you are running with project dependencies, then you will need to set up some/all of the following:</p>
      <p>In phenote, the project dependencies could be all of:</p>
      <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-phenote-project-dependencies.png"
         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <p>For BBOP, be sure to export some of the jars:</p>
      <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-bbop-export.png"
         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <p>For OBO, there are dependencies on BBOP, be sure to include those under "projects"</p>
      <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-obo-dependencies.png"
      alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
      class="image" />
      <p>For OBO-Edit, there are dependencies on BBOP, OBO, and also be sure to export some of the jars:</p>
      <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-oboedit-export.png"
         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <img src="http://www.phenote.org/images/eclipse-oboedit-project-dependencies.png"
         alt="Phenote in Eclipse"
         class="image" />
      <h2>Other things to note about Eclipse</h2>
<p>The source code for Phenote (and for the BBOP and OBO libraries that it depends on) changes frequently. To stay up to date inside Eclipse, use the right mouse menu option "Team -> Update". To update from the shell, use <code>svn update</code>.</p>

<p>Note that if you are using Eclipse but you do an svn update from the shell, or make any other changes outside of Eclipse, you will need to do a "Refresh" in Eclipse to get it in sync. Also note that if new jars are added to the project, you might need to add them to your Java Build Path in Eclipse (see above).</p>

<p>If you wish to stay informed of every single svn commit, you can <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/obo-svn-commit">join the svn commits mailing list</a>.</p>
