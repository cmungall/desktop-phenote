	    Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO)</a>
	</h2> 	
	<p> 
	An ontology of phenotypic qualities (properties). This ontology
	can be used in conjunction with other ontologies such as GO or 
	anatomical ontologies to refer to phenotypes. Examples of 
	qualities are red, ectopic, high temperature, fused, small, 
	edematous and arrested.

	  <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">
	    Gene Ontology (GO)</a>
	</h2> 
	<p>
	The Gene Ontology (GO) project is a collaborative effort to address 
	the need for consistent descriptions of gene products in different 
	databases. 
	The Gene Ontology project provides a controlled vocabulary to 
	describe gene and gene product attributes in any organism.  There
	are three distinct ontologies developed by GO:  molecular function,
	biological process, and cellular component.

	    Ontologies for Biomedical Investigations
	  </a>
	</h2> 
	<p>
	  The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project is
	  developing an integrated ontology for the description of
	  biological and medical experiments and investigations. This
	  ontology will support the consistent annotation of
	  biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular
	  field of study.

	The OBO Foundry is an open, inclusive, and collaborative core of
	interoperable ontologies developed by the research community.  The
	goal is to facilitate the creation of consistent, compatible, and 
	unambiguous ontologies thereby supporting the biomedical research
	community.  The contributors are those biological researchers and 
	ontology developers who have agreed to work together on an evolving 
	set of design principles that can foster interoperability of 
	ontologies, and ensure a gradual improvement of quality and formal 
	rigor in ontologies, in ways designed to meet the increasing needs 
	of data and information integration in the biomedical domain.

	</h2> 
	<p>
	  The Ontology Lookup Service is a spin-off of the PRIDE
	  project, which required a centralized query interface for
	  ontology and controlled vocabulary lookup. While many of the
	  ontologies queriable by the OLS are available online, each
	  has its own query interface and output format. The OLS
	  provides a web service interface to query multiple
	  ontologies from a single location with a unified output
	  format.

	<p>
	  The Plant Ontology Consortium (POC) aims to develop, curate
	  and share structured controlled vocabularies (ontologies)
	  that describe plant structures and growth/developmental
	  stages. Through this effort, the project aims to facilitate
	  cross database querying by fostering consistent use of these
	  vocabularies in the annotation of tissue and/or growth stage
	  specific expression of genes, proteins and phenotypes.
