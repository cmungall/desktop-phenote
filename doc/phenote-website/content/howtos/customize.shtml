<h1><a name="config">How-To:  Customize Phenote</a></h1>
<p>
Phenote can be customized in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#input">specify input fields</a> and their types</li>
  <li><a href="#data_adapter">adding a custom data adapter</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ontologies">specify ontologies</a></li>
  <li><a href="#post-comp">specify if an ontology field allows for post-composition</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ontology-updating">turn on/off ontology-updating</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Some basics on customizing phenote:
</p>
<p>Make sure you've already tried running the webstart edition of phenote.  Running this once should leave a directory on your computer called ".phenote".  On a PC this will be under C:/Documents and Settings/UserName/.phenote.  On a mac it will be in your home dir (easiest to get to via a terminal window).
</p>
<p>
Open up the file "my-phenote.cfg" from ".phenote/conf/".  It should have one line of text that says "zfin-standalone.cfg".  If it doesn't, change this to the name of the file that contains your custom phenote configuration.
</p>
<p>
Next, copy your custom configuration file into the ".phenote/conf/" directory. 
</p>
<p>To get a custom ontology that is local and not on SF, you'll have to copy it into ".phenote/obo-files/".  Any reference to this ontology within your configuration file must match the filename.
</p>
<p>
Then, you should be able to start phenote with the same webstart link as before, but it should load with this new configuration.  you can also start it by double-clicking on the java icon that downloaded to your desktop called "phenote-zfin" or somesuch.
