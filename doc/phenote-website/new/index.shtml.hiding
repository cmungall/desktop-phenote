	  Welcome to the OBO Foundry
	</div>

	<p>
	  The mission of OBO is to support community members who are
	  developing and publishing ontologies in the biomedical
	  domain. It is our vision that a core of these ontologies
	  will be fully interoperable, by virtue of a common design
	  philosophy and implementation, thereby enabling scientists
	  and their instruments to communicate with minimum
	  ambiguity. In this way the data generated in the course of
	  biomedical research will form a single, consistent,
	  cumulatively expanding, and algorithmically tractable
	  whole. This core will be known as the "OBO Foundry".
	</p>
	<p>
	  The OBO Foundry is open, inclusive and collaborative. The
	  contributors are those biological researchers and ontology
	  developers who have agreed to work together on an evolving
	  set of design principles that can foster interoperability of
	  ontologies, and ensure a gradual improvement of quality and
	  formal rigor in ontologies, in ways designed to meet the
	  increasing needs of data and information integration in the
	  biomedical domain. By joining the OBO Foundry, the authors
	  of an ontology commit to its maintenance in light of
	  scientific advance, and to soliciting community feedback for
	  its improvement. They also give an assurance that they will
	  work with other Foundry members to ensure that, for any
	  particular domain, there is community convergence on a
	  single reference ontology.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This site contains OBO Foundry ontologies and points to some
	  other related efforts. It also provides discussion fora,
	  technical infrastructure, and other services to facilitate
	  ontology development. Please contribute, we welcome feedback
	  and encourage participation.
