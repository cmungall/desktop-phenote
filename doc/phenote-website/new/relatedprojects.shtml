		<h3> <a href="http://www.gmod.org/">Generic Model Organism Databases</a></h3> 
		<p class="description">
			The Generic Model Organism Project (GMOD) is a joint effort by the model organism system databases WormBase, FlyBase, MGI, SGD, Gramene, Rat Genome Database, EcoCyc, and TAIR to develop reusable components suitable for creating new community databases of biology. 
		</p>
		<h3> <a href="http://obi.sourceforge.net/">Ontologies for Biomedical Investigations</a></h3> 
		<p class="description">
 The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and medical experiments and investigations. This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://ifomis.org">Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science 
(IFOMIS)</a></h3>
		<p class="description">
The Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science 
(IFOMIS) comprehends an interdisciplinary research group with members 
from Philosophy, Computer and Information Science, Logic, Medicine, 
and Medical Informatics, focusing on theoretically grounded research 
in both formal and applied ontology.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://mged.sf.net/">MGED</a></h3> 
		<p class="description">
			The Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) Society is an international organisation of biologists, computer scientists, and data analysts that aims to facilitate the sharing of microarray data generated by functional genomics and proteomics experiments. 
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/">Ontology Lookup Service</a></h3> 
		<p class="description">
			The Ontology Lookup Service is a spin-off of the PRIDE project, which required a centralized query interface for ontology and controlled vocabulary lookup. While many of the ontologies queriable by the OLS are available online, each has its own query interface and output format. The OLS provides a web service interface to query multiple ontologies from a single location with a unified output format. 
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.plantontology.org/">Plant Ontology Consortium</a></h3> 
		<p class="description">
			The Plant Ontology Consortium (POC) aims to develop, curate and share structured controlled vocabularies (ontologies) that describe plant structures and growth/developmental stages. Through this effort, the project aims to facilitate cross database querying by fostering consistent use of these vocabularies in the annotation of tissue and/or growth stage specific expression of genes, proteins and phenotypes. 
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/258">Proteomics Standards Initiative</a></h3>
		<p class="description">
		Is also interested in guidelines for the development of Controlled Vocabularies.
		</p>
		<h3><a href="http://www.sofg.org/">Standards and Ontologies for Functional Genomics</a></h3> 
		<p class="description">
			SOFG is both a meeting and a website; it aims to bring together biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists who are developing and using standards and ontologies with an emphasis on describing high-throughput functional genomics experiments.
