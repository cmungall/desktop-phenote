	    NCBO Bioportal

	<p>
	  On this page you can find a listing of biomedical ontologies 
	  that have been submitted to the NCBO.  From there you can link
	  to their project websites, download the ontology files, and search
	  their contents.

	</h3> 
        <p>
	The OBO Foundry is an open, inclusive, and collaborative core of 
	interoperable ontologies developed by the research community. 
	The goal is to facilitate the creation of consistent, compatible, 
	and unambiguous ontologies thereby supporting the biomedical 
	research community. The contributors are those biological 
	researchers and ontology developers who have agreed to work 
	together on an evolving set of design principles that can 
	foster interoperability of ontologies, and ensure a gradual 
	improvement of quality and formal rigor in ontologies, in ways 
	designed to meet the increasing needs of data and information 
	integration in the biomedical domain.

	  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/">
	    Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)
	  </a>
	</h3> 
	<p>
	The Ontology Lookup Service is a spin-off of the PRIDE project, 
	which required a centralized query interface for ontology and 
	controlled vocabulary lookup. While many of the ontologies 
	queriable by the OLS are available online, each has its own 
	query interface and output format. The OLS provides a web 
	service interface to query multiple ontologies from a single 
	location with a unified output format.
