	  OBO Foundry Principles
	</div>

	<p>
	  OBO is an open community and, by joining the initiative, the
	  authors of an ontology commit to its maintenance in light of
	  scientific advance and to working with other members to
	  ensure the improvement of these principles over time. The
	  OBO Foundry is an attempt to apply the scientific method to
	  the task of ontology development, and the scientific method
	  rests on constant criticism and on the assumption that no
	  resource will ever exist in a form in which it cannot be
	  further improved.

	  principles please send e-mail to

	  <ol>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology must be <em>open</em> and available to be
		used by all without any constraint other than (a) its
		origin must be acknowledged and (b) it is not to be
		altered and subsequently redistributed under the
		original name or with the same identifiers.</h3>
	      
	      <p>
		The OBO ontologies are for sharing and are resources
		for the entire community. For this reason, they must
		be available to all without any constraint or license
		on their use or redistribution. However, it is proper
		that their original source is always credited and that
		after any external alterations, they must never be
		redistributed under the same name or with the same
		identifiers.
		</p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology is in, or can be expressed in,
		a <em>common shared syntax</em>. This may be either the
		OBO syntax, extensions of this syntax, or OWL. </h3>
	      <p>
		The reason for this is that the same tools can then be
		usefully applied. This facilitates shared software
		implementations. This criterion is not met in all of
		the ontologies currently listed, but we are working
		with the ontology developers to have them available in
		a common OBO syntax.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontologies possesses a <em>unique identifier
		  space</em> within the OBO Foundry.</h3>
	      <p>
		The source of concepts from any ontology can be
		immediately identified by the prefix of the identifier
		of each concept. It is, therefore, important that this
		prefix be unique.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology provider has procedures for identifying
		distinct successive <em>versions</em>.</h3>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology has a clearly specified and
		clearly <em>delineated content</em>.</h3>
	      <p>The ontology must be orthogonal to other ontologies
		already lodged within OBO.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The major reason for this principle is to allow two
		different ontologies, for example anatomy and process,
		to be combined through additional relationships. These
		relationships could then be used to constrain when
		terms could be jointly applied to describe
		complementary (but distinguishable) perspectives on
		the same biological or medical entity.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		As a corollary to this, we would strive for community
		acceptance of a single ontology for one domain, rather
		than encouraging rivalry between ontologies.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontologies include textual <em>definitions</em>
		for all terms. </h3>
	      <p>
		Many biological and medical terms may be ambiguous, so
		concepts should be defined so that their precise
		meaning within the context of a particular ontology is
		clear to a human reader.
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology uses relations which are unambiguously
	      defined following the pattern of definitions laid down
		in the <em>OBO Relation Ontology</em>.</h3>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology is <em>well documented</em>.</h3>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology has a plurality of
		independent <em>users</em>.</h3>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <h3 class="crit">The ontology will be
		developed <em>collaboratively</em> with other OBO
		Foundry members.</h3>
	    </li>
