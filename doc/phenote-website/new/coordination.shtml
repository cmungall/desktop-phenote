	 Coordination of the OBO Foundry
	</div>

	<p>
	  The coordinators of the OBO Foundry are
	  <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/ashburner.htm">
	    Michael Ashburner
	  </a>
	  (NCBO, GO),
	  <a href="http://www.berkeleybop.org/content/people/cjm/">
	    Chris Mungall
	  </a>
	  (NCBO, GO, BBOP),
	  Suzanna Lewis
	  (NCBO, GO, BBOP), and
	  <a href="http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/">
	    Barry Smith
	  </a>
	  (NCBO, ORG).
	</p>

	<p>
	  The intention is to provide light-weight management,
	  although the growth of OBO may, in the future, necessitate a
	  more formal structure. It is appropriate to view these
	  people as facilitators who assist independent ontology
	  developers: by organizing meetings, making introductions
	  between different groups, offering comments when requested,
	  engaging in e-mail discussions, making resources available,
	  and other means. They work to ensure that the ontologies
	  being developed are mutually compatible, expandable, and
	  correctable in line with advances in biomedical
	  science. Ontologies are tools of communication, and their
	  utility rests on the network effects that come with wide
	  acceptance. Experience thus far confirms that adherence to
	  OBO principles is largely self-policing because of the
	  positive benefits that accrue to individual members. The
	  task of the OBO coordinators is to help to build this
	  community.
