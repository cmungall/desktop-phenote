	<h3>
	  <a href="crit.shtml">
	    Current Principles
	  </a>
	</h3>
	<p>
	  OBO consists of ontologies which either conform to, or are
	  committed to working towards conforming to, the OBO Foundry
	  principles. The OBO coordinators are committed to working
	  with ontology developers to aid this process, and they are
	  also committed to keeping these Foundry Principles under
	  review.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
	  <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org">

	</h3>
	<p>
	  Our main page contains a tabular listing of the current set
	  of ontologies in the OBO Foundry. The table can be sorted by
	  clicking on column headings, and you can find further
	  information by clicking on the ontology name.
