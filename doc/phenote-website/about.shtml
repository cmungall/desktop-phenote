	  About Phenote
	</div>

	<p>
	Phenote is both a complete piece of software and a software toolkit designed to facilitate the annotation of biological phenotypes using ontologies.  It provides an interface to record genotype-phenotype pairs, together with the provenance for the annotation.  Typical users of Phenote include literature curators, laboratory researchers, and clinicians looking for a method to record data in a user-friendly and computable way.
	</p>
	<p>
	Data annotated with Phenote is based on the <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/~cjm/obd/pheno-syntax.html">EQ model</a> for representing phenotypes, combining entities from any ontology with qualities (such as PATO).
        <a target="_new" href="http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/1/R2/">This paper</a> talks more about the semantics of the EQ model.
