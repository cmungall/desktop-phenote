<h1>1.8</h1>

<h2>1.8.4</h2>
<ul>
	  <li> bugfix: Graph View was showing only immediate parent(s), now shows whole tree (bug fixed in OBO-Edit)</li>
	  <li> bugfix: Fixed problem finding obo files in jar (broken between 1.7-beta16 and 1.7-beta17)</li>
	  <li> bugfix: Term Info panel layout improvements (e.g., made fonts match; left more space for long relationship names in Parent/Child panel)</li>
	  <li> bugfix: Improvements to appearance of splash screen and configuration chooser on Windows</li>
	  <li> change:  If there's no .phenote directory and Phenote can't create it (this was
  happening to me when I ran the Windows emulator), it now pops up an
  error dialog and then exits.</li>
</ul>


<h2>1.8.2-3</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 1.8.2 and 1.8.3 are essentially the same as 1.8.1.  The only changes are that some configuration and ontology files have been updated, and 1.8.3 now explicitly requires you to have Java 1.6 installed
 (please see <a href="/help/html/Phenote_from_the_Command_Line.htm">this page</a> for more information about Java versions).</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.8.1</h2>

<ul>
<li> feature: Made tabs in Annotation Editor configurable in two ways:
<ul>
<li>Ability to designate number of fields per tab</li>
<li>Ability to name tabs and assign fields to named tabs</li>
</ul>
Both are specified in the config file.  For specifying the number of fields
per tab, use the fields-per-tab attribute:
<pre>&lt;fields-per-tab numfields="12"/&gt;</pre>
For naming tabs, simply add tab="TabName" to each &lt;field&gt;.  You can have as
many different tab names as you want.  If you specify tab names, the
fields-per-tab attribute (which normally defaults to 8) is ignored.
</li>
<li>feature: Added ability to search dbxrefs during term autocompletion.
Whether or not to search dbxrefs is configurable from menu and config file,
just like other options (name, synonym, etc.).</li>
<li> If a field has a description (desc) defined in the configuration, then it
will pop up  as a tooltip if you hover your mouse over the field name in the
Annotation Editor.</li>
</ul>

<h1>1.7</h1>

<h2>07.20.2010, Version 1.7-beta16</h2>
<ul>
  <li> bugfix: Better recovery from problems with config files (for example, when
auto-update doesn't work, like last week, when SourceForge wasn't working
right).  If auto-updated config file doesn't work, Phenote now tries to find
its own cached copy of the config file and uses that instead.  (It no longer
changes your configuration to Flybase.)  If all attempts fail, it pops up an
error window explaining that the user's selected configuration is no good, and
prompts them to choose a new configuration.</li>
  <li> bugfix: Better error messages when there's something wrong with one of the ontology
files Phenote uses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>07.01.2010, Version 1.7-beta15</h2>
<ul>
  <li> bugfix: Config files now don't auto-update if they have when="NEVER" (fix for
  bug 3017776)</li>
  <li> bugfix: Fixed updating of user-selected ontology files.  Fixes these bugs:
    <ul>
    <li> "Ontology Update" dialog ignoring choices - ID: 2925894</li>
    <li> update ontologies update button misleading message - ID: 2950774</li>
    </ul>   
 </li>
  <li> bugfix: Fixed command-line option for loading an annotation file
    on launch (e.g., phenote -f data/mydatafile.tab).  Added documentation
    about command-line options to user guide.</li>
  <li> bugfix: Fields in Annotation Editor no longer cut off</li>
</ul>   

<h2>06.17.2010, Version 1.7-beta14</h2>
<ul>
<li>bugfix: Changes to zfin configs to fix problems reported by Ceri Van Slyke</li>
<li>bugfix: Partial fix (improvement, at least) for several related bug reports:
<ul>
<li>3013449--Can't delete ontology-constrained terms in Annotation Editor</li>
<li>1850306--cell contents disappear in row selection</li>
<li>2972788--Field edits sometimes get lost unless you hit enter</li>
<li>1874953--multi select wipes out data</li>
</ul>
The failure to commit changes made in ontology-constrained fields in the
Annotation Editor mostly happened if, rather than hitting return in the newly
empty field, you hit tab (to go to the next field) or clicked on something
else. (However, it didn't reliably happen even then--sometimes it worked
fine.)  I noticed the behavior the most when selecting multiple rows, and then
clicking on the field in the Annot Editor to empty it, and hitting tab.
Usually, the terms were not deleted as desired (but sometimes they were!).
<br>
I have improved the behavior somewhat by checking TermCompLists (these
ontology-constrained fields) for focusLost (i.e., user tabbed or clicked out
of the field--these weren't registering as KeyEvents) and not just for return,
but it still sometimes seems not to do the right thing.
</li>
<li>change: New Phenote logo</li>
<li>change: Updated dialog that comes up while Phenote is loading (but it still
  sometimes comes up blank)</li>
</ul>

<h2>05.06.2010, Version 1.7-beta12</h2>
<ul>
<li>bugfix: Fixed bug 2993230: terms used in annotations that are not in any currently
loaded ontology were getting lost (not shown in annotation table; not saved in
roundtrip).
Now these unknown terms are not lost, and they are visually indicated in the
Term Info window with an orange bar that says "UNKNOWN TERM".</li>
</ul>

<h2>04.19.2010, Version 1.7-beta11</h2>
<ul>
<li>bugfix: Elimanted double warning popup if there are issues when you save (e.g., missing fields).</li>
<li>bugfix: Will now warn you when you try to load a new data file if you've made changes in the current file.</li>
<li>bugfix: Term info browser now syncs with other components (such as Graph Editor)
to show the selected term when we follow parent/child hyperlinks in the Term Info window.</li>
<li>feature/bugfix: Now you can double-click a term in the annotation table and the Term Info
browser AND any open OBO-Edit components such as the Graph Editor will change
to show that term!  Before, you had to edit the term and get a dropdown
completion list and pick something from it (even if you just picked what was already there) before you could convince the Term
Info and other windows to show the term.</li>
<li>bugfix: Green checkmark in Term Info (to use currently shown term, which may have been reached by
following parent/child hyperlinks) now functions correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>03.01.2010, Version 1.7-beta10</h2>
<ul>
<li>bugfix: Can now run Phenote when you're offline (even if it's the first
  time you've launched it).</li>
</ul>

<h2>02.23.2010, Version 1.7-beta9</h2>
<ul>
<li>bugfix: In 1.7-beta6, we enabled Phenote to use the config file in .phenote if it couldn't
update it from the master repository.  This version adds similar robustness
for the ontology files: if Phenote can't get new ones from the repository for some
reason, it just uses the local copies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>02.18.2010, Version 1.7-beta8</h2>
<ul>
<li> feature: Greatly improved startup speed by loading each ontology once, rather than
multiple times, in OntologyDataAdapter.mapNamespacesToOntologies
</li><li> bugfix: Europen-style dates in input (e.g., "20.10.2009") could not be parsed, and
thus were lost and not saved in the output.
Phenote can now handle THAT SPECIFIC DATE FORMAT (dd.MM.yyyy) as well as the
default SimpleDateFormat.  Any other date format will still fail.
</li><li> change/bugfix: Turned off splash screen, which was causing some computers to freeze up.  Would like to fix and restore at some point.
</ul>

<h2>Jan-Feb 2010: 1.7-beta1 through beta7 (internal releases)</h2>
<ul>
<li>change: <b>Phenote+ is now just called Phenote.  The old Phenote UI will be de-supported.</b>
</li><li> feature: <b>Added support for proxies.</b>  Users can now set proxy via a GUI.  All
ontology-fetching, date-checking, etc. will then be done via the proxy that is
set.  Proxy setting is saved in user's config.xml.
</li><li> bugfix: Fixed Help/User Guide (wasn't working at all) in standalone version.
(Still problematic in webstart.)
</li><li> bugfix: Improved About.
</li><li> bugfix: Fixed Apple->Exit (was doing nothing)
</li><li> bugfix: When you ran Phenote for the first time from the installed version, it would
let you choose your config and then would show nothing at all for several minutes
while it downloads the ontology files.  Now it at least pops up a dialog box
that says "Updating ontology files--please wait".  Unfortunately, I can't get
it to put anything inside the dialog box until it's done downloading the
ontology files (by which point it's pointless), but at least it now shows
SOMETHING so that new Phenote users don't think it's crashed.
</li><li> bugfix: Fixed some out-of-date stuff in some config files (e.g. plant.cfg)
</li><li> change: Made "Date created" field show up in Annotation Table for
zfin-standalone.cfg (at request of ZFIN curator David Fashena).
</li><li> change: If we fail to get a new copy of the config file from the repository,
just use the local copy--don't give up and use the flybase config.
</li><li> change: Phenote title bar now shows name of last file loaded (or saved).
</li><li>bugfix: In 1.7-b7, fixed save bug introduced some time around 1.7-beta2
</li>
</ul>

<h1>1.6</h1>

<h2>08.20.2008, version 1.6 - beta8</h2>
<ul>
<li>change: Renaming Phenote2 configuration to PhenotePlus to avoid any
  confusion with a future Phenote 2.0 release
</li><li>change: Renaming "Comp" button to "Compose" in AnnotationEditor Panel which more
  intuitively suggests composition of ontology terms with relationships.
</li><li>feature: Layout menu now has "Import perspective" to add a new perspective (from an
.idw file)--phenote request https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1909081&group_id=76834&atid=887913.
</li><li>change: "ncbo" config renamed "human" 
</ul>

</li><li>feature: added updates & deletes to birn soap adapter 
</li><li>bugfix: fixed constraint message bug for failure constraints 
</li><li>feature: popups to user on birn soap success & failure per asifs request 
</li><li>bugfix: if field has both retrieve button and list the list was laying on top of retrieve button </li><li>now retrieve is left of del button in this case 
</li><li>bugfix: commits to query/db adapters are now ignoring blank rows as they should 
</li><li>bugfix: Fixed problem with TermInfo panel not following clicks on links. 
</li><li>bugfix: Change to OboUtil so that pre-composed terms are not expanded in post-comp editor. 
</li><li>bugfix: Catching IOException so that the application can start up even though neither an ontology URL or cached file is available.  Need to devise a user alert for this situation. 
</ul>
Worm adapter changes:
<ul>
</li><li>bugfix: Phenotype retrieves now work. 
</li><li>feature: added Genetic Intx Desc retrieve for Jolene.  It also searches for ``NOT NULL'' if the words typed are exactly ``NOT NULL''.  
</li><li>bugfix: Commit uses transactions. If sql fails, get a popup instead of a crash. 
</li><li>change: Changed Strain to Host Strain, added new type called Strain 
</li><li>change: took out from worm.cfg host strain, penetrance range start, penetrance range end. added app_control_isolate to postgres, .cfg, WormAdapter.java  
</li><li>change: Added ``suggested definition'' (text) and ``child of'' (phenotype obo) fields. Moved ``Paper Remark'' and ``Paper Remark History'' to the end.

<li>change:  configurations birn, worm, ncbo, etc., were all updated with the
"big text box" for the "description" field</li>
<li>bugfix: layouts/perspectives are no longer automatically overwritten at
application close [<a

<li>bugfix:  a strange bug where a change to the configuration with the "select
config" option in phenote was not preserving the change with the new
windows-installer.  this was a specific problem to the ncbo.cfg
configuration. this originated with a bug in the configuration file, and has
now been remedied. [<a

<h1>1.5</h1>
<h2>03.03.2008, version 1.5 - release</h2>
<p>With the release of version 1.5, we are transitioning over to a new interface.  We will continue to support the webstart version of phenote for a couple of releases, but will ultimately switch to the standalone version that is debuting in this release.  The new 'Phenote+' will have at least the same capabilities as the original Phenote, but new components will be only added to the new interface.  Be sure to choose the proper phenote (or phenote plus) when entering bug reports</p>
<ul>

<h2>07.20.2007, version 1.4-beta2</h2>


<ul>


  <li>feature: RESTful data input for BIRN's smart atlas</li>


  <li>feature: Character Template for NESCent/CToL (Jim Balhoff). This
is an additional window which edits a separate list of characters using
a subset of the fields in the main window. The fields to include are
denoted by a group in the config file. This functionality will be used
by the PhenoMap project to create a specimen list. The same EQ
statement can be applied to many specimens at once by selecting the
relevant specimens and generating characters in the main window with
the template fields pre-filled. All the new characters are selected and
can then be bulk edited.</li>

<h1>0.6</h1>
<h2>07.28.2006, version 0.6-fly, 0.6-zfin, Webby Phenote
(0.6)</h2>

<ul>

  <li>new: webbified phenote. This is in its extremely early stages
(very little functionality and buggy). At this point it only does
Entity and Quality fields and term info and thats it, and even thats
buggy, but more coming soon! </li>

  <li> feature:  writing pheno-xml format, and uses the latest
PATO ontology (as of July 28, 2006).</li>

</ul>


<h1>0.5</h1>

<h2>05.12.2006, version <a href="phenote/0.5/phenote-flybase.jnlp">0.5-FlyBase</a>, <a href="phenote/0.5/phenote-zfin.jnlp">0.5-ZFIN</a></h2>

<p>
No new additions to the gui here. In preparation for my visit to
Cambridge/FlyBase, I worked on a FlyBase dataadapter. This is phenote
first data adapter so I also laid down the foundations for data
adapters. The FlyBase data adapter simply cuts and pastes phenotype
character objects to the system clipboard. The idea is that FlyBase's
Proforma java application will also cut and paste to the clipboard.
This is a simple way to pass objects between applications, to get us
off the ground. Proforma is not there yet so this has not been
tested yet with Proforma, but it works in the test suite. Added special
FlyBase character wrappers that do the parsing and creating of Proforma
character strings.</p>


<h1>0.4</h1>

<h2>04.26.2006, version 0.4-flybase, 0.4-zfin</h2>

<ul>

  <li>feature:  Added Genetic Context field.</li>

  <li>feature:  Parent &amp; child terms in term info are now clickable/navigable.</li>

  <li>feature:  HTML Links in descriptions are clickable (should bring up default browser)</li>

  <li>feature:  configuration files to configure ontologies &amp; fields. This is
currently at a devloper level (xml file) not a user level(gui - todo).
There is a command line argument for which configuration file to use.
This allows for having separate zf &amp; fb releases without having to
change the code to do it (like was done for the ctol release). The
configuration for now is for developers (internal xml file), on the
todo is to have a gui configuration for users.</li>

  <li>bugfix: can't delete to 0 rows</li>

  <li>bugfix: synonym search duplicates removed</li>

  <li>Development: Refactored for configuration &amp; adding field.
Made the internal code much more generic for adding new fields from
configuration, got rid of a lot of hard wiring.&nbsp; Part of this was
instituring model-view-controller in some places where views were
improperly talking to other views. In theory this should also make it
easier to plop a web gui on top of the current phenote model &amp;
controller.</li>

  <li>Development:  Renamed Phenotype to Character. Added Character interface CharacterI.</li>

  <li>Development: Added tests to test suite.</li>

</ul>

<h1>0.3</h1>
<h2>04.07.2006, version 0.3, 0.3.1 (for CToL)</h2>

<p>Note:  0.3.1 is identical to 0.3 except that it has ontologies for CToL
(fish evolution group). In particular it uses a fish taxonomy
ontology for the id (in this taxonomy) choosing. On the todo is the
ability to configure ontologies, but not there yet, so for now need to
hardwire with seaparate jar file. This clearly makes the todo item a
bit more pressing.</p>

<p>  Release for NESCent fish eveolution meeting. No major new functionality
here. Cleaned up and fixed a lot of the bugs in 0.2, which was rather
buggy.</p>

<ul>

  <li>feature:  Completion terms now sorted alphabeitcally.</li>

  <li>bugfix:  Selection of item in comp list causing exception, not going in term box</li>

  <li>bugfix:  No terms with just 1 char</li>

  <li>bugfix:  Popup was staying up after selection</li>

  <li>development:  Test suite added! (todo: add more tests)</li>

  <li>development:  Migrated to jdk 1.5 (which caused some of the bugs above)</li>

  <li>development:  Ant file made build.xml.</li>

  <li>development:  CompletionList refactored into Ontology (prompted by sorting)</li>

</ul>

<h1>0.2</h1>

<ul>

  <li>feature:  term completion on Synonyms, Definitions and Obsoletes</li>

  <li>feature:  mouse-over on term in completion list displays info in 'term info' text area</li>

  <li>Todo: layout, scrollbar, border w title, ordering &amp; lumping
parents
&amp; children, formatting. Also perhaps have children &amp; parents be
clickable in some fashion either html-like clickable text or as buttons.</li>

  <li>known bugs:  If you hit backspace in term completion fields it gets wacky </li>

</ul>


<h1>0.1</h1>

<h2>03.01.2006, version 0.1</h2>

<p> 0.1 was the initial phenote release (known briefly as the plumper at
the time).  It just had a genotype, anatomy and pato fields, where
anatomy and pato did term completion (just on term names) with there
ontologies in a drop down list. There was also the phenotype table that
tracked phenotype instances being edited in the above fields. This very
limited functionality was demo'd at the cbio meeting 3/3/06 at Stanford.</p>
