  <title>Java version for Phenote</title>

<h1>Java requirements for Phenote</h1>

<br>

Phenote requires Java 1.5. We hope this is OK with everybody. If there
are issues please let us know(mgibson@fruitfly.org). 1.5 has been out
for around 2 years, and has a lot of nice features. The big issue is
Macs. Mac Tiger supports 1.5 where earlier version (Panther &amp;
earlier) do not as far as we know. So upgrading to Tiger would then be a
requirement for using Phenote. Tiger has been out for over a year now
and is now pretty stable, so we hope this isn't a cumbersome
requirement. We have emailed with zfin and it seems the Mac users there
are actually already all upgraded to Tiger.<br>

<br>

As for windows, linux and solaris, if you do not already have jdk 1.5
it can be downloaded from sun:<br>
