<h1>Downloading Phenote</h1>

	<ol>
	  <li>Download your platform-specific package.  (For MacOS, this should self-extract into a disk image. If it doesn't, double-click on the file.  You should see an
	  icon for the "drive" that the Phenote application is on.)</li>
	  <li>Double-click on the Phenote installer icon.  This will open up the installer software.  You will be asked a few questions, such as the installation location.</li>
	  <li>When it's finished installing, you are ready to go!
	  Double-click the Phenote application icon to launch Phenote.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<p> We will continue to post links to major releases on this website.
	You can also install new releases from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76834">Phenote SourceForge Project page</a>.</p>

	<h3>Webstart edition</h3>
        <p>The webstart edition is currently unavailable while we resolve some
        problems.  Please use the installer edition instead.</p>

	<h3>Note about Phenote and Phenote+</h3>
        <p>There's a small nomenclature change starting in v1.7.  In 2008, the
        Phenote developers introduced a new "look and feel" to the Phenote
        user interface.  They called this new version "Phenote+".  At that
        time, Phenote+ was considered a still-experimental version, and
        "regular" Phenote was still available.  We have decided that it's time
        to retire the old Phenote interface and make the Phenote+ interface
        the default.  (Phenote+ will henceforth be referred to as "Phenote";
        there won't be anything called "Phenote+".)

	  Recently added features and bug fixes, Phenote version 1.7-b10
	</div>

	<div class="content_box_blue">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Phenote+ is now just called Phenote.  The old Phenote UI will be de-supported.</b>
            </li><li><b>Added support for proxies.</b>  Users can now set proxy via a GUI.  All
              ontology-fetching, date-checking, etc. will then be done via the
              proxy that is set.
            </li><li>Deals better with failure to update ontology files from remote
            URLs (falls back on local copies instead).
            </li><li>Improved startup speed by loading each ontology once at startup, rather than
              multiple times.
            </li><li>Now handles Europen-style dates in annotation files
            (e.g., "20.10.2009").
            </li><li> Can run even if you're offline
