	  Note about Phenote and Phenote+
	</div>

	<div class="content_box_blue">
        <p>In 2008, the
        Phenote developers introduced a new "look and feel" to the Phenote
        user interface.  They called this new version "Phenote+".  At that
        time, Phenote+ was considered a still-experimental version, and
        "regular" Phenote was still available.  Starting with Phenote release
        1.7, the developers decided that it's time
        to retire the old Phenote interface and make the Phenote+ interface
        the default.  (Phenote+ will henceforth be referred to as "Phenote";
        there won't be anything called "Phenote+".)</p>
