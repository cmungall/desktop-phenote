<h1>Downloading Phenote</h1>
	<h2>For users</h2>
	<h3>Phenote installer edition</h3>
	Platform-specific installers are available for Phenote v1.7-b12 at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76834">SourceForge</a> or here:
	<a href="http://www.phenote.org/phenote/1.7/Phenote_1_7-beta12_macos_install4j.dmg">MacOS X</a> |
	<a href="http://www.phenote.org/phenote/1.7/Phenote_1_7-beta12_windows_install4j.exe">Windows</a> |
	<a href="http://www.phenote.org/phenote/1.7/Phenote_1_7-beta12_linux_install4j.rpm">Linux</a> |
	<a href="http://www.phenote.org/phenote/1.7/Phenote_1_7-beta12_unix_install4j.sh">Unix</a>
	<ol>
	  <li>Download your platform-specific package.  (For MacOS, this should self-extract into a disk image. If it doesn't, double-click on the file.  You should see an
	  icon for the "drive" that the Phenote application is on.)</li>
	  <li>Double-click on the Phenote installer icon.  This will open up the installer software.  You will be asked a few questions, such as the installation location.</li>
	  <li>When it's finished installing, you are ready to go!
	  Double-click the Phenote application icon to launch Phenote.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<p> We will continue to post links to major releases on this website.
	You can also install new releases from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76834">Phenote SourceForge Project page</a>.</p>

	<h3>Webstart edition</h3>
        <p>The webstart edition is currently unavailable while we resolve some
        problems.  Please use the installer edition instead.</p>

	<h3>Note about Phenote and Phenote+</h3>
        <p>There's a small nomenclature change starting in v1.7.  In 2008, the
        Phenote developers introduced a new "look and feel" to the Phenote
        user interface.  They called this new version "Phenote+".  At that
        time, Phenote+ was considered a still-experimental version, and
        "regular" Phenote was still available.  We have decided that it's time
        to retire the old Phenote interface and make the Phenote+ interface
        the default.  (Phenote+ will henceforth be referred to as "Phenote";
        there won't be anything called "Phenote+".)

	  Recently added features and bug fixes, Phenote version 1.7-b11 and 1.7-b12
	</div>

	<div class="content_box_blue">
          <ul>
          <li> Can run even if you're offline</li>
          <li>Will now warn you when you try to load a new data file if you've made changes in the current file.</li>
          <li>Term info browser now syncs with other components (such as Graph Editor)
            to show the selected term when we follow parent/child hyperlinks in the Term Info window.</li>
          <li>Now you can double-click a term in the annotation table and the Term Info
            browser AND any open OBO-Edit components such as the Graph Editor will change
            to show that term.  Before, you had to edit the term and get a dropdown
            completion list and pick something from it (even if you just picked what was already there) before you could convince the Term
            Info and other windows to show the term.</li>
          <li> (b12) Terms used in annotations that are not in any currently
          loaded ontology are no longer lost (and are now visually indicated in
          the Term Info window).
