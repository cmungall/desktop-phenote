<h1>The Explanation Plugin</h1>
<p>The explanation plugin displays the explanation for any 
currently selected links. When the explanation plugin is opened, it looks like 
this:</p>
<p><IMG height=155 hspace=0 src="../images/explanation_plugin_initial.gif" 
width=366 border=0></p>
<p>Initially, the explanation plugin just shows a list of the currently selected 
links. Double click a link to see its explanation:</p>
<p><IMG height=183 hspace=0 src="../images/explanation_plugin_initial_.gif" 
width=395 border=0></p>
<p>The current link has two explanations: GIVEN, and an explanation based on the 
TRANSITIVITY rule. (This means that this is a redundant link, since it is GIVEN 
- hence created by a human - and can be inferred by the reasoner. See <A 
href="The_OBO_Edit_Reasoner.htm#redundant">redundant links</A>).</p>
<p>Whenever any line is selected in the explanation tree, more details are 
given&nbsp;in the text field at the bottom of the window. In this case, since a 
link is selected, all that is shown is the link description.</p>
<p>Note the little control next to the TRANSITIVITY explanation. This means that 
the explanation can be expanded to show the links that support the explanation. 
Double-click and explanation (or just click the expand control) to show the 
supporting links:</p>
<p><IMG height=219 hspace=0 src="../images/explanation_plugin_supporti.gif" 
width=602 border=0></p>
<p>The two supporting links show how the implied link "virion transport vesicle 
-part_of-&gt; intracellular" was derived: "virion transport vescicle -is_a-&gt; 
intracellular membrane-bound organelle" and "intracellular membrane-bound 
organelle" -part_of-&gt; intracellular", therefore "virion transport vesicle 
-part_of-&gt; intracellular".
</p>
<p>Notice that there are expansion controls next to each piece of supporting 
evidence. If these are expanded, we see the supporting evidence <em>for</em> the 
supporting evidence:</p>
<p><IMG height=259 hspace=0 src="../images/explanation_plugin_meta_sup.gif" 
width=505 border=0></p>
<p>We can see that "intracellular membrane-bound organelle -part_of-&gt; 
intracellular" is itself an implied link, because its only explanation is 
TRANSITIVITY.&nbsp;It is possible to expand that explanation to 
discover&nbsp;the relevant supporting links, which can in turn be expanded to 
display their evidence, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>When the explanation tree for any link is fully expanded, all the leaves 
will&nbsp;be the GIVEN explanation, because all implied links are initially 
derived from the user-provided links in the ontology.&nbsp;</p>
