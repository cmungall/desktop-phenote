<h1>Changing your Autocompletion Settings</h1>
<p>By default, autocompletion search will include Term 
names as well as Synonyms.&nbsp; The other 
options to choose from include:</p>
<p><strong>Term name - </strong>The 
name of the term itself.</p>
<p><strong>Synonym</strong> - The name of the synonym for a term.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> -&nbsp;Partial matches are based on 
inclusion within the definition of a term.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>DBXref</strong> - Looks for matches within the DBxrefs for a term. </p>
<p><strong>Obsoletes </strong>- This is an optional setting to be used in 
combination with one of the settings above.&nbsp; It will look for matches to 
term name, synonym, DBxref, or definition in terms that are marked as obsolete, in 
addition to non-obsoleted terms.&nbsp; In order to select obsolete search, you 
must have at least one of the other four search options selected.  (By
  default, Phenote does not search obsolete terms.)</p>
<p>To change these settings, simply check on/off the desired option in the Settings menu:</p>

<p>You can also save your autocompletion settings in your configuration file
using the <code>autocomplete-settings</code> parameter, e.g.<br>
<code> &lt;autocomplete-settings term="true" synonym="true" definition="false" obsolete="false" dbxref="true"/&gt; </code>
