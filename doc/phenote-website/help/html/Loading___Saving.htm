<h1>Loading &amp; Saving</h1>
<h3>        Loading Annotations</h3>
<p>    Choose File-&gt;Open... A dialog like this will appear:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/open_dialog.png" 
border=0></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  The drop down "Files of Type" box contains a list of data 
adapters.&nbsp; To choose a different data adapter, click on the little upside-down triangle, and select 
it from the dropdown list.&nbsp; The list of valid extensions for each 
data adapter is also listed shown.</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/data_adapter_open_list.png" 
border=0>              
               
            
     </p>
<p>When opening an Annotation file, if "All Files" is selected 
and your file has an extension appropriate for the data type, the data adapter will 
be applied automatically.&nbsp; For example if your filename is "example.xls", the tab-delimited 
data adapter will be automatically used.</p>
<p>If your current configuration does not match that used 
when the file was previously saved, then you might encounter an error during 
loading.&nbsp; For example, when you saved this file the last time, you were 
operating under the "demo" configuration.&nbsp; However, since then, you 
switched your configuration to "my_new_config".&nbsp; Since these configurations 
might not match, you are unable to load in the data.&nbsp; Try <A 
href="Changing_your_Configuration.htm">changing your configuration</A>              
               
        back to "demo" and 
then retry loading the annotation file.&nbsp;</p>

    Saving Annotations</h3>
<p>              
           To save a file, 
select the appropriate output format, type in the name of the file 
(including the extension), and click "Save".&nbsp;</p>
<p>              
    Note that you can also select a filename that already exists 
which will overwrite the file. (There is no warning in the software 
itself, so this is your warning.)</p>

<p>              
               
            
     &nbsp;</p>
<P>Warning:&nbsp; If you give an extension to a filename that is not valid for 
that selected format, you may encounter problems during loading.&nbsp; For 
example, if you save your file as "example.xls" but the format you tell it to 
save as is PhenoSyntax, then when the file is loaded it might try to use the 
tab-delimited adapter instead of the phenosyntax adapter, resulting in your data 
hangin' in space.&nbsp; Be sure to use the appropriate combination of extension 
and adapter.</P>
