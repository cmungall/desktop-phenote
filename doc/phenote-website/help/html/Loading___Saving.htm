<H3>        Loading Annotations</H3>
<P>    Choose File-&gt;Open... A dialog like this will appear:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/open_dialog.png" 
border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  The drop down "Files of Type" box contains a list of data 
adapters.&nbsp; To choose a different data adapter, click on the little upside-down triangle, and select 
it from the dropdown list.&nbsp; The list of valid extensions for each 
data adapter is also listed shown.</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/data_adapter_open_list.png" 
border=0>              
               
            
     </P>
<P>When opening an Annotation file, if "All Files" is selected 
and your file has an extension appropriate for the data type, the data adapter will 
be applied automatically.&nbsp; For example if your filename is "example.xls", the tab-delimited 
data adapter will be automatically used.</P>
<P>If your current configuration does not match that used 
when the file was previously saved, then you might encounter an error during 
loading.&nbsp; For example, when you saved this file the last time, you were 
operating under the "demo" configuration.&nbsp; However, since then, you 
switched your configuration to "my_new_config".&nbsp; Since these configurations 
might not match, you are unable to load in the data.&nbsp; Try <A 
href="Changing_your_Configuration.htm">changing your configuration</A>              
               
        back to "demo" and 
then retry loading the annotation file.&nbsp;</P>

<P>              
           To save a file, 
select the appropriate output format, type in the name of the file 
(including the extension), and click "Save".&nbsp;</P>
<P>              
    Note that you can also select a filename that already exists 
which will overwrite the file. (There is no warning in the software 
itself, so this is your warning.)</P>
