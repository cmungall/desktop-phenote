<H1>  Introduction</H1>
<P>Phenote&nbsp;loads and saves data through the use of 
<STRONG>data adapters.</STRONG> Data adapters are little code modules that know 
how to get data into or out of Phenote. A data adapter may read data from a 
formatted file on a hard drive, write data to a relational database, or download 
a file from CVS.</P>
<P>Every file format/database schema/whatever is different. Many 
data adapters have complex options, particularly when saving data. Phenote has 
three data adapters built-in:&nbsp; PhenoXML, PhenoSyntax, and a tab-delimited format.f&nbsp; (And soon will have 
an OBO-edit 1.3 annotation format adapter.)</P>
<P>This section provides a general overview of how to load and save, and then an 
in-depth discussion of each of Phenote's built-in data 
adapters.</P>
