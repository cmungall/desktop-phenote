<H1>  Introduction to Data Adapters</H1>
<P>Phenote&nbsp;loads and saves data by means of 
<STRONG>data adapters.</STRONG> Data adapters are code modules that know 
how to get data into or out of Phenote. A data adapter might read data from a 
formatted file on a hard drive, write data to a relational database, or download 
a file from SVN/CVS.</P>
<P>Every file format or database schema is different. Many 
data adapters have complex options, particularly when saving data. Phenote
currently has 
three built-in data adapters:&nbsp; PhenoXML, PhenoSyntax, and a tab-delimited
  format.&nbsp; (It soon will have 
an OBO-edit 1.3 annotation format adapter.)</P>
<P>This section provides a general overview of how to load and save, as well as an 
in-depth discussion of each of Phenote's built-in data 
adapters.</P>
