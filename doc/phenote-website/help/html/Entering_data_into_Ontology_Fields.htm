<h1>Entering data into Ontology Fields</h1>
<p>Note:&nbsp; by default, autocompletion search settings 
will include Term <em>names</em> as well as <em>synonyms</em>.&nbsp; If you would like to change these 
settings, read the <A href="Changing_your_Autocompletion_Settings.htm">Changing 
your Autocompletion Settings</A> help page.</p>
<h3>Step 1: &nbsp;(optional) select an ontology</h3>
<p>By default, the autocompletion feature will search on 
ALL ontologies specified for the field.&nbsp; You can change this, and choose a 
specific ontology by selecting one from the drop-down list (the list is 
displayed when the small upside-down triangle is clicked):</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/prot-autocomplete-ont.png" 
border=0>     </p>
<h3>     &nbsp;</h3>
<h3>  Step 2:&nbsp; begin typing...</h3>
<p>As you start typing in an ontology field, a list of 
partial matches will show in a scrollable box below.&nbsp; In this example, the 
phrase <EM>prot</EM>           
             
  has several matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><IMG height=0 hspace=0 
src="../images/prot-autocomplete-ex.png" width=0 border=0><IMG hspace=0 
src="../images/prot-autocomplete-entry.png" border=0></p>
<P> Matches are listed in the following order within the box:</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>starts with - partial matches to term names that 
    start with the text entered&nbsp;
    <LI>contains - partial matches that are contained 
    within the term name
    <LI>synonyms - indicated with "[syn]"
    <LI>definitions - indicated with "[def]"
    <LI>obsoletes - indicated with "[obs]"</LI></UL></UL>    
    <p >If you have selected to search in 
ALL ontologies, then the matches are listed in this order, in the order of the 
ontologies.&nbsp; For example, you will find a matches to "kidney" in FMA before 
you will find them in GO.</p>
<H3>        &nbsp;</H3>
<H3>Step 3: scroll down to find your matching term</H3>
<P>You can navigate through these matches with the 
scrollbar on the right side of the box.&nbsp; The more letters typed increases 
the specificity of the matches displayed.&nbsp;</P>
<P>As you scroll down the list, either with arrow keys or 
the mouse, information about the term will be displayed in the Term Info window, which may help in 
your decision whether or not the term is appropriate for&nbsp;the current&nbsp;annotation.&nbsp; In this example 
I have moused-over the term <EM>proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein 
catabolic process</EM>.&nbsp; The term info window shows:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/prot-autocomplete-terminfo.png" border=0></P>
<P>FAQ: what if i want a more specific term related to 
this?</P>
<P>FAQ: what if i can't find the term name i'm looking for?</P>
<H3>         
&nbsp;</H3>
<H3>Step 4: select the term to insert into the 
spreadsheet</H3>
<P> Once you have found the correct term to use for 
your annotation, select it by clicking the left mouse button.&nbsp; Selecting a 
term will trigger the drop-down box of matches to disappear, and your selected&nbsp;term to be 
displayed in the appropriate field in the spreadsheet:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/prot-autocomple-table.png" 
border=0></P>
<P>Note:&nbsp; if you do not click the mouse button on a 
term from the drop-down list, then your term will not be selected.&nbsp; 
currently, even if you type the exact term name it will not be chosen before 
moving to the next field.</P>
<P>If, once you have selected a term, you want to change 
it, simply select another term from the same search or delete the current text 
and start typing something new.</P>
