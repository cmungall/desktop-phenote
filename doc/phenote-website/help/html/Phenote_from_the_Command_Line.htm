<h1>Running Phenote from the Command Line</h1>
<h2>1) Install Java 1.5 or higher</h2>
<p>On Macs, Java 1.6 (also known as Java SE 6) can be installed automatically by doing a system software update. On any other platform, download 
the appropriate binaries for the latest Java <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>.
To run Java applications, all you need is the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). If 
you need all the tools to run and <em>create</em> Java applications, download 
the J2SE SDK (Software Development Kit).</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h1>What version of Java do I have?</h1>
<hr>

<p>Most new computers come with some version of Java already installed. To 
figure out what version you have, open up a command prompt, or console, or 
terminal, or whatever you use on your platform to type commands onto a 
command-line. Then type:</p><code><dd><b>java -version</b></dd></code> 
<p>and press enter. You should get a response like:</p>
<br><code><b>java version "1.6.0_20"<br>Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, 
Standard Edition (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.3-b01-279, mixed mode)
</b></code> 
<p>The first line tells you which version of Java is installed.</p>
<p>If you get a response like:</p>
<br><code><b>'java' is not recognized as an internal or external 
command, operable program or batch file.</b></code> 
<p>or</p>
<br><code><b>bash: java: command not found</b></code> 
<p>then check that you typed a space after "java" and before "-version". If you 
entered the command correctly but still do not get a response indicating a 
specific version of Java, then Java is not installed, and you need to follow the 
installation instructions above.</p>

</div>
<h2>2) Get Phenote</h2>
<p>The latest development version of Phenote can be retrieved 
from&nbsp;SourceForge.net Subversion repository through SVN with the following 
instruction set: </p><pre>svn co <A href="https://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obo/phenote/trunk">https://obo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/obo/phenote/trunk</A>&nbsp;phenote </pre></p>
<p>Please see the <a href="developer-docs/getting-source-code-in-eclipse.shtml">Phenote developer docs</a> for more information about downloading and compiling Phenote.</a>
<h2>  3) Launch Phenote</h2>
<ul>           
  <li>           
            On 
  Unix platforms (including Mac OSX), run the "phenote" shell script 
  to start the program (to do this on most Unix platforms, cd 
  the Phenote directory and type "./phenote").</li>
  <li>On Windows or Mac, you can double-click the Phenote icon to launch the
  application.</li></ul>

<h2>  4) Optional command-line arguments</h2>
<p>When invoking Phenote from the command line, you can use one or more of these command-line options if you wish:
<pre>
Options:
  -f, --inputFile=filename         Filename to read in 
  -w, --writeFile=filename         Filename to write to
  -c, --configSet=config file      Specify config file to use (should be a .cfg 
                                   file in conf directory).  (Note that this 
                                   change applies only to the current Phenote 
                                   session--the next time you launch Phenote, it
                                   will revert to your previously set 
                                   configuration.)
  -u, --updateConfig=config file   Specify config file to update from conf 
                                   directory.  Adds in new config fields; if 
                                   nothing to update just loads config file as 
                                   is.
  -l, --logFile=filename           Specify log file

  -?, --help                       Show this help message
  --usage                          Show brief usage message
</pre>
So, for example,
<pre>phenote -c plant.cfg</pre>
would launch Phenote using the plant configuration, and
<pre>phenote -f data/mydatafile.tab</pre>
would bring up Phenote with the annotations in mydatafile.tab already loaded.
