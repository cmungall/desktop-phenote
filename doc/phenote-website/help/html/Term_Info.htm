<h1>Term Info</h1>
<p>The Term Info window is a text-based ontology browser.&nbsp; It
displays any relevant metadata about an ontology term selected in the
  Annotation Table.  Double-click a term in the Annotation Table to make it
  come up in the Term Info window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metadata displayed in the Term Info window includes:</p>
<p><strong>Ontology</strong> - the name of the Ontology from which the term 
comes, in this case the Biological Process ontology from the Gene Ontology.</p>
<p><strong>Term</strong> - the actual name of the term</p>
<p><strong>ID</strong> - the official alphanumeric identifier 
for the term.&nbsp; It is often presented in the format&nbsp;of a unique&nbsp;abbreviation 
for the ontology followed by a numeric identifier, separated with a colon 
(e.g., GO:0007605).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Synonyms</strong> - many terms have 
synonyms.&nbsp; These synonyms&nbsp;may&nbsp;be defined as having different 
scope, such as: Exact, Narrow, Broad,&nbsp;or Other.&nbsp; If the 
synonym&nbsp;is from a particular categorization (such as an abbreviation, a 
chemical formula, a community standard like IUPAC,&nbsp;etc.), this will be 
indicated following the synonym in brackets.&nbsp; If no synonyms are present, 
this section will not appear.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> - the definition for the term is displayed</p>
<p><strong>Replacements</strong> - If a term is obsoleted, 
a replacement term is often recommended by the maintainers of the ontology, or 
at minimum other terms to consider are mentioned.&nbsp; These will be listed with navigable links.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Navigating an Ontology in Term Info</h3>
<p>Each term in an ontology is related to at least one other term.&nbsp; Those 
terms, and their relationships are displayed in the Term Info window as 
well.&nbsp; In the example above, the term <em>sensory perception of sound</em> 
<strong>is a</strong> child of <em>sensory perception of mechanical 
stimulus</em>.&nbsp; Each term is&nbsp;a hyperlink.&nbsp; Clicking on these 
terms will load that new information into the Term Info window.&nbsp; If I were 
to select the <em>sensory perception of mechanical stimulus</em> link, the Term 
Info window would look like this:</p>
<p><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/term_info_linked.png" border=0></p>
<p>In the list of children, you can see a 
link from where we just came:&nbsp;<em>sensory perception of sound</em></p>

<h3>Selecting a Term</h3>
<p>If you want the term shown in the Term Info window to be used in your
currently selected annotation, click the green check icon in the upper right.
