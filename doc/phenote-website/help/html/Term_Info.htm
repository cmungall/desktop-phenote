<P>The Term Info window is a text-based ontology browser.&nbsp; This window will 
display any relevant metadata about an ontology term selected in the Data Entry 
frame, such as:</P>
<P><STRONG>Ontology</STRONG> - the name of the Ontology from which the term 
comes, in this case the Biological Process ontology from the Gene Ontology.</P>
<P><STRONG>Term</STRONG> - the actual name of the term</P>
<P><STRONG>ID</STRONG> - the official alphanumeric identifier for the 
term.&nbsp; It is often presented in the id:####### format.&nbsp; The id part 
before the colon usually reflects the abbreviation for the ontology and should 
be unique.</P>
<P><STRONG>Synonyms</STRONG> - many terms have synonyms, especially between 
different communities.&nbsp; If no synonyms are present, this section will not 
appear.</P>
<P><STRONG>Definition</STRONG> - the definition for the term is displayed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Navigating an Ontology in Term Info</H3>
<P>Each term in an ontology is related to at least one other term.&nbsp; Those 
terms, and their relationships are displayed in the Term Info window as 
well.&nbsp; In the example above, the term <EM>sensory perception of sound</EM> 
<STRONG>is a</STRONG> child of <EM>sensory perception of mechanical 
stimulus</EM>.&nbsp; Each term is&nbsp;a hyperlink.&nbsp; Clicking on these 
terms will load that new information into the Term Info window.&nbsp; If I were 
to select the <EM>sensory perception of mechanical stimulus</EM> link, the Term 
Info window would look like:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/term_info_linked.png" border=0></P>
<P>and if&nbsp;I move the slider to see the rest of the window, I will see a 
link from where we just came:&nbsp;<EM>sensory perception of sound</EM></P>
