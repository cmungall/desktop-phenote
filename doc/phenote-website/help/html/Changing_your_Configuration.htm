<H1>Changing your Configuration</H1>
<P>If you would like to select a different Phenote configuration, this can be 
accomplished from inside Phenote.</P>
<P>Select the menu item Settings-&gt;Set Configuration...</P>
<P>This will pop up a menu of choices, listing the many configurations that come 
pre-packaged with Phenote.&nbsp; The radio button next to your currently loaded 
configuration will be highlighted:</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/change_config.png" 
border=0></P>
<P>To select a new configuration, click on the radio button next to the 
configuration of your choice, and click OK.  If you decide not to change your
  configuration after all, you can just destroy the configuration selection window. </P>
<P>You will need to quit and restart Phenote for the changes to take effect.</P>
<P>If you would like to utilize a customized configuration, 
please read the section on <A href="What_is_a_Configuration_.htm">Customizing 
Phenote</A>            
    for more information.</P>
<H2>Changing Your Proxy Setting</H2>
<P>Some computers use a proxy to get data over the internet.  Phenote
  needs to download ontology files from the internet, so if your computer uses
  a proxy, you will need to tell Phenote that.
You can change your proxy setting via the menu item Settings-&gt;Set
  Configuration...</P>
<P>Click the "Set proxy..." button at the bottom of the configuration window.
  A small Proxy Settings window should appear.
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/proxy-config.png" border=0></p>
<p>If you check the "Use proxy"
  box, you can enter a proxy name (or IP address) and port.  Be sure to
        indicate whether your proxy uses the HTTP or SOCKS protocol.
</p><p>
Your proxy setting is saved in your personal configuration file (config.xml)
in your Phenote configuration directory.  You can turn it off or change it at
any time by using the "Set Configuration" menu item (as above), and Phenote
will remember your setting even after you quit and relaunch.
