<h1>How To Edit a Configuration File</h1>
<DIV id=page_body>
<H2>
<H2>Getting Started</H2></H2></DIV>
<P>You can&nbsp;see&nbsp;sample configuration files and their corresponding 
Phenote screenshots in <A href="Sample_Configuration_1.htm">Sample Configuration 
1</A> and <A href="Sample_Configuration_2.htm">Sample Configuration 2</A> 
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way to get comfortable with editing your own 
configuration file is to simply edit an existing configuration. &nbsp;You can 
copy the text from the sample configurations in this help file, or you can copy 
an existing configuration file that is distributed with Phenote. <STRONG><FONT 
color=#ff0000>As a precaution, be sure to save your edited configuration 
file&nbsp;with a new filename to prevent any accidental overwriting by our 
server&nbsp;when you upgrade to a new Phenote version.</FONT>&nbsp; </STRONG><!--#include virtual="/ssi/footer.shtml" --></P>
<DIV>
<H2>The basics</H2>

<p>Make sure you've already tried running the webstart 
edition of phenote (you can also run phenote from the command line). Running 
this once should leave a directory on your computer called ".phenote". 
<DIV>        
                          
  <ul>
    <li>On a Mac, you will find this located under the <FONT 
  color=#ff0000>MacintoshHD:Users:YourAccount</FONT>          
   directory, although you probably will not see it 
  in a "finder" window. You do have access to it if you run a "terminal" window. 
  It will be located in your user directory. 
    <li>On a PC, this is located in the <FONT 
  color=#ff0000>C:/Documents and Settings/YourAccount/</FONT>          
    </li>
  </ul></DIV>
<p></p>

<h2>Location of your configuration file</h2>
<p> The configuration files used by Phenote are located in 
the <FONT color=#ff0000>".phenote/conf</FONT>           " directory.
</p>
<p>
Within 
this directory you can store any number of configuration files. The  default files that come with the webstart versions are named "flybase.cfg", "zfin-standalone.cfg", or "human.cfg", etc., depending on which version you've used in the past.  Any file you create/modify should be placed in this directory.
</p>

<h2>How to change your Phenote configuration</h2>
<p>
Once you have placed or modified your configuration file 
in the <FONT color=#ff0000>".phenote/conf</FONT>
         " directory, you need to tell Phenote to use that particular file. Note that

with Phenote v1.1 or later, the user can choose a different configuration from the "File" menu. When you  
select "Load Configuration", you are prompted with a list of options. (In v1.2  and later, this option is under the "Settings" menu.)
Listed are several configuration styles that come standard with the Phenote software, with the current choice's radio-button selected.
If you have created your own custom configuration file with a ".cfg" extension, it should be listed here.  
After selecting (the radio button) for a new configuration, press "OK", or press "Cancel" to revert to your previous selection.  
Any changes to your configuration settings will take effect the next time Phenote is loaded.  
</p>
<p>
Then, you should be able to start phenote with the same webstart link as before, but it should load with this new configuration.  you can also start it by double-clicking on the java icon that downloaded to your desktop called "phenote.jnlp".
</p>
<h2>Location to put your personal obo files</h2>
<p>To get a custom ontology that is local and not on SF, 
you'll have to copy it into "<FONT color=#ff0000>.phenote/obo-files/</FONT>                  ".  Any reference to this ontology within your configuration file must match the filename.
