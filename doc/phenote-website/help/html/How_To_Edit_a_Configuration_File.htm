<h1>How To Edit a Configuration File</h1>
<DIV id=page_body>
<H2>Getting started</H2></DIV>
<P>You can&nbsp;see&nbsp;sample configuration files and their corresponding 
Phenote screenshots in <A href="Sample_Configuration_1.htm">Sample Configuration 
1</A> and <A href="Sample_Configuration_2.htm">Sample Configuration 2</A> 
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way to get comfortable with editing your own 
configuration file is to simply edit an existing configuration. &nbsp;You can 
copy the text from the sample configurations in this help file, or you can copy 
an existing configuration file that is distributed with Phenote. <STRONG><FONT 
color=#ff0000>As a precaution, be sure to save your edited configuration 
file&nbsp;with a new filename to prevent any accidental overwriting by our 
server&nbsp;when you upgrade to a new Phenote version.</FONT>&nbsp; </STRONG><!--#include virtual="/ssi/footer.shtml" --></P>
<DIV>
<H2>The basics</H2>

<p>Before you try editing a configuration file, make sure you've launched
  Phenote at least once.  This should create a directory
on your computer called ".phenote". 
<DIV>        
                          
  <ul>
    <li>On a Mac, you will find your .phenote directory in <FONT 
  color=#ff0000>MacintoshHD:Users:YourUsername</FONT>,
      although you probably will not see it 
  in a "finder" window, because finder windows do not show directories that
  start with ".". You do have access to it from a "terminal" window. 
      </li>
    <li>On other Unix systems, your .phenote directory will be in your home
    directory (~).</li>
    <li>On a PC, look in <FONT 
  color=#ff0000>C:/Documents and Settings/YourAccount/</FONT>          
    </li>
  </ul></DIV>

<h2>Location of your configuration file</h2>
<p> The configuration files used by Phenote are located in 
the <FONT color=#ff0000>".phenote/conf</FONT>           " directory in your
  home directory.
</p>
<p>
Within 
this directory you can store any number of configuration files. The  default files that come with the webstart versions are named "flybase.cfg", "zfin-standalone.cfg", or "human.cfg", etc., depending on which version you've used in the past.  Any file you create/modify should be placed in this directory.
</p>

<h2>How to change your Phenote configuration</h2>
<p>
Once you have placed or modified your configuration file 
in the <FONT color=#ff0000>.phenote/conf</FONT>
directory, you need to tell Phenote to use that particular configuration file.  
</p>
<P>See <A href="Changing_your_Configuration.htm">Changing your configuration</A> 
for instructions.</P>
<P>If you have created your own custom configuration file with a ".cfg" 
extension, it should be shown in the list of known configurations.&nbsp; Any changes to your 
configuration settings will take effect the next time you launch Phenote
</P>
<h2>Where to put personal ontology files</h2>
<p>To use a custom ontology file in Phenote, 
copy the file into <FONT color=#ff0000>.phenote/obo-files/</FONT>.  Any reference to this ontology within your configuration file must match the filename.
