      one organism type, they should only need one organismal 
      ontology.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, developmental timing/staging is 
      included in separate ontologies, that may need to be used 
separately.</TD></TR>

can use any ontology for your annotations, provided it is in OBO format.&nbsp;

the repository of your choice, such as</P>
