<h1>Advantages to Annotation with Ontolgies</h1>
<P>The power of Phenote lies in its use of <EM>ontologies</EM> to represent 
concepts during data annotation.&nbsp; Ontologies represent domains of knowledge 
by defining concepts or <EM>entities</EM> within a particular domain (and the 
terms used to refer to them) as well as how the entities are related to each 
other. An ontology thus provides a vocabulary for communicating knowledge about 
a topic, as well as a computable representation of the underlying reality.&nbsp; 
Use of a well-structured, domain-expert-reviewed ontology for biological 
annotation allows the curated data to be understandable by both humans and 
computers, thereby increasing the capacity for meaningful analysis.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Using ontologies during annotation has several advantages:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>User errors (such as typos) during data entry are 
  minimized, delivering better-quality datasets 
  <LI>Because each term in an ontology is defined, exact 
  concepts are used and recorded, rather than "fuzzy" human language, 
  in which words and phrases can have more than one meaning 
  <LI>Given the proper analysis tools, the resulting data can be mined in the 
  context of the broader knowledge contained within the ontologies.&nbsp;
