<h1>What is Phenote?</h1>
<p>Phenote&nbsp;is a general-purpose open source platform-independent 
application to facilitate data annotation&nbsp;using&nbsp;ontologies.</p>
<p>Originally developed as a literature curation tool for biomedical phenotype 
annotation, Phenote can be customized to suit any user-specified domain 
requiring ontology-based annotation. The all-in-one interface allows users to 
quickly search and view corresponding metadata for relevant ontology terms 
during data entry, browse through the ontology in a navigation window, and view 
the data annotations in a spreadsheet-like window. Data recorded with Phenote 
can be ported to any external application or database using one of its built-in 
data adapters, or by plugging in a custom data adapter generated with the 
API.</p>
<p>Phenote is a project of the Berkeley Bioinformatics Open-Source Projects 
(<a href='http://www.berkeleybop.org'>BBOP</a>).</p>
