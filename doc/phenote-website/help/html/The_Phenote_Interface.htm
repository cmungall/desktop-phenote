<h1>The Phenote Interface  </h1>
<p>This screenshot is of Phenote when configured with the "demo" configuration and loaded 
with data.&nbsp; It is a typical interface for phenotype 
annotation.  </p>
<p><IMG src="../images/phenote-data-markup.png" width="100%" border=0>  The Phenote application window is comprised of three main areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Data Entry frame located in the&nbsp;upper left. 
  <li>The Term Info frame located in the&nbsp;upper right. 
  <li>The Annotation Spreadsheet located in the lower half.</li></ul>
<p>The Phenote application runs best in 1024x768, but&nbsp;the window is easily 
adjusted to meet your specific size needs.</p>
