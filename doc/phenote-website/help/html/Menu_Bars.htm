<h1>Menu Bars</h1>
<p>Phenote has four menus with the following 
functions (many of which also have keyboard shortcuts):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>File</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Open&nbsp;- prompts the user to load a set of 
    annotations saved to their computer.&nbsp; 
    <li>New - clears any currently loaded annotations and lets 
    the user start over 
    <li>Save/Save As - prompts the user to save the current 
    annotations to a file
    <li>Exit - closes Phenote</li></ul>
  <li><strong>Edit</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Undo - undoes the last edit</li>
      <li>Redo - redoes the last edit that you undid</li>
      <li>Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All - these perform as in most applications.  Note
      that before you can use these functions, you must click in the
      Annotation Table to bring the focus there.</li>
      <li>Add Annotation - adds a new line to the Annotation Table</li>
      <li>Duplicate Annotation - adds a copy of the currently selected
      annotation</li>
      <li>Delete Annotation - deletes the currently selected annotation(s)</li>
      <li>Enter and Select Next - this is just a reminder that if you hit
      return while you're in the Annotation Table, you will move to and select
      the next annotation after the one you're currently on.</li>
  <li><strong>Settings</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The first four items under Settings are Search Filters - users can select the filters to be 
    used during autocompletion of ontology fields. 
    <ul>
      <li>Term Name 
      <li>Synonyms 
      <li>Definitions 
      <li>Obsoletes</li></ul>
    <li>Set Configuration - allows the user to choose a 
    different Phenote configuration or to set (or turn off) a proxy
    <li>Lock Docking Components - The components in the Phenote display can
    be moved around and detached as separate windows.  This command locks
    them in place so you don't inadvertently move them.  Select it again to
    turn off locking.</li></ul>
  <li><strong>Help</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>User Guide - brings up this help documentation 
    within the Phenote Application.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>About - brings up a small window showing the version number 
</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find out more information on many of these functions by looking through 
this documentation.</p>
