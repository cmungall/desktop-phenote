<h1>Phenote Webstart</h1>
<p>Phenote is a Java application,&nbsp;that can be launched 
from the web using Java Webstart.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
<h2>Downloading and Running Phenote</h2>    </h2>
<p>You can access Phenote webstart&nbsp;at the website, <A 
href="http://www.phenote.org/content/software/">http://www.phenote.org/content/software/</A>.&nbsp; Clicking on 
the "Webstart" link will download the application and place a link 
'phenote.jnlp' in your download location (typically your Desktop) and 
run.&nbsp;&nbsp;The indication that a link works is that you get a popup that 
says "Java Loading", or something like that and then a bunch of files get 
downloaded 
and eventually the application actually comes up.&nbsp; It will ask you to verify 
a security certificate from the National Center for Biomedical 
Ontology.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
   If nothing happens, this may indicate that your browser is 
not properly configured.&nbsp; See instructions below for configuring your 
browser.</p>
<p>In the future, you can start the software by clicking the 'phenote.jnlp' 
link.</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Phenote might take a few minutes to get started.&nbsp; Since many ontolgies 
are updated everyday, it is important to keep in synch with the resources.&nbsp; 
So, every time you start Phenote it checks to see if there are newer versions of 
ontologies available for download.&nbsp; If so, it will automatically download 
the newest versions to your local computer.&nbsp; (This feature can be disabled 
in the future.&nbsp; See the <A href="What_is_a_Configuration_.htm">Customizing 
Phenote</A> section for more information.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2>Configuring your MacOS or Windows browser for Webstart</h2>
<p>You must have Java 1.5 or later installed on your computer. Your browser must 
be configured to recognize webstart appications with the 'jnlp' extension. Most 
Mac and Windows browsers tend to have webstart pre-installed on their browsers, 
but you may be asked to update the Java that is installed. </p>
<h2>Configuring your Linux browser for Webstart</h2>
<p>              
           
            
 Linux browsers tend not to have webstart pre-installed.&nbsp; You must set up an 
association between the MIME type, which is an 
"application/x-java-jnlp-file".<br></p>
<p>These are the steps I had to go through to get webstart installed on my 
Mozilla browser on Linux, which does not come with webstart pre-installed:</p>
<h3>Download/Install Java Webstart</h3>
<p>First you need to see if you have webstart already installed on your 
computer. If you have java on your computer then usually webstart comes with 
java so you should have it. So if you have java you first need to find out where 
it is installed. In linux you type "which java" at the command line. For me this 
comes back with<br><br>/usr/lib/java/bin/java</p>
<p>Since Phenote requires Java 1.5, you need to make sure you are using java 
1.5. Do a "java-version" at the command line. If you have anything less than 
1.5, you need to install java 1.5, or if you have 1.5 installed somewhere (but 
its not the default) you need to find it and grab its javaws. If you try to 
webstart phenote with a java less than 1.5 nothing will happen and it won't even 
indicate that its the wrong java, you just have to know.<br><br>So what I found 
is in java 1.5 javaws is in both the bin and jre directory. So cd to 
/usr/lib/java and do a "ls jre" and "ls bin" (on windows "dir jre" &amp; "dir 
bin") and look for a file called "javaws", which is the webstart application. 
The full path plus javaws is what you will need below. So for me its 
"/usr/lib/java/jre/javaws"<br><br>If webstart is not on your computer (or 
network) you can download it from(make sure its from java 1.5):<br><br><a

<h3>Associating the MIME type</h3>
<p>Now that we've found the webstart application we are ready to associate it 
with a mime type in the browser. Here is how it is done in Mozilla on linux, I 
hope other browsers are somewhat similar.<br><br>Hit the "Edit" menu, and its 
"Preferences" sub menu to get the Preferences dialog.&nbsp; Expand the 
"Navigator" category, and under that click on "Helper Application", which is 
where mime types get associated with applications. Click the "New Type" button, 
which brings up a New Type dialog box. In the "MIME Type" field enter 
"application/x-java-jnlp-file".&nbsp; Under "Description" you can just put "Java 
Webstart". Under "Extension" put "jnlp". Click on "Open it with:" and in the 
associated field either entor or browse for the location of webstart on your 
computer. This is what you were digging for above. For my computer I enter 
"/usr/lib/java/jre/javaws", the location of my webstart app. then deselect 
"Always ask me before handling files of this type", as who wants to keep being 
asked, and hit "OK" and hit "OK" as well in the Helper Applications 
dialog.<br><br>You now need to restart your browser for it to pick up the new 
mime type association for webstart and hopefully the above link should now work. 
</p>
<h2>Other Hints</h2>
<p>One thing thats also handy if there are problems bringing up webstart is to 
bring up the browser's java console (this may not be supported by all browsers). 
This should give some feedback on things happening behind the scenes of the 
webstart application, so its good for trouble shooting. In mozilla this can be 
brought up with menu Tools-&gt;Web Development-&gt;Java 
Console.<br></p>
