<H1>Running Phenote for the First Time</H1>
<H2>Choosing the Configuration</H2>
<P>The very first time you start phenote, a window will 
popup and ask you to choose a configuration:</P>
<P><IMG height=0 hspace=0 src="../images/config-screenshot.png" width=0 
border=0><IMG hspace=0 src="../images/config-screenshot.png" border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For demonstration purposes, we will work with the "demo" 
configuration.&nbsp; Select this option and press OK.&nbsp; Phenote will 
continue to load, but might take a few minutes to get started.&nbsp; Since many 
ontolgies are updated everyday, it is important to keep in synch with the 
resources.&nbsp; So, every time you start Phenote it checks to see if there are 
newer versions of ontologies available for download.&nbsp; If so, it will 
automatically download the newest versions to your local computer.&nbsp; (This 
feature can be disabled in the future.&nbsp; See the <A 
href="What_is_a_Configuration_.htm">Customizing Phenote</A>          
            
           section for more 
information.)</P>
