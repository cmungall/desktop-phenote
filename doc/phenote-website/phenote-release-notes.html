<h2>0.6<hr></h2>
07.28.2006, version <a href="0.6/phenote-flybase.jnlp">0.6-fly</a>, <a href="0.6/phenote-zfin.jnlp">0.6-zfin</a>, 
<a href="http://reaper.lbl.gov/phenote/html/ncbo.html">Webby Phenote
(0.6)</a><br>
<ul>
  <li>new:  webbified phenote.  This is in its extremely early stages (very little functionality and buggy). At this point it only does Entity and Quality fields and term info and thats it, and even thats buggy, but more coming soon! </li>
<li> feature:  writing pheno-xml format, and uses the latest
PATO ontology (as of July 28, 2006).</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.5<hr></h2>
05.12.2006, version <a href="0.5/phenote-flybase.jnlp">0.5-FlyBase</a>, <a href="0.5/phenote-zfin.jnlp">0.5-ZFIN</a><br>
<p>
No new additions to the gui here. In preparation for my visit to
Cambridge/FlyBase, I worked on a FlyBase dataadapter. This is phenote
first data adapter so I also laid down the foundations for data
adapters. The FlyBase data adapter simply cuts and pastes phenotype
character objects to the system clipboard. The idea is that FlyBase's
Proforma java application will also cut and paste to the clipboard.
This is a simple way to pass objects between applications, to get us
off the ground. Proforma is not there yet so this has not been
tested yet with Proforma, but it works in the test suite. Added special
FlyBase character wrappers that do the parsing and creating of Proforma
character strings.</p>

<h2>0.4<hr></h2>
04.26.2006, version <a href="0.4/phenote-flybase.jnlp">0.4-flybase</a>, <a href="0.4/phenote-zfin.jnlp">0.4-zfin</a><br>
<ul>
  <li>feature:  Added Genetic Context field.</li>
  <li>feature:  Parent &amp; child terms in term info are now clickable/navigable.</li>
  <li>feature:  HTML Links in descriptions are clickable (should bring up default browser)</li>
<li>feature:  configuration files to configure ontologies &amp; fields. This is
currently at a devloper level (xml file) not a user level(gui - todo).
There is a command line argument for which configuration file to use.
This allows for having separate zf &amp; fb releases without having to
change the code to do it (like was done for the ctol release). The
configuration for now is for developers (internal xml file), on the
todo is to have a gui configuration for users.</li>
<li>bugfix: can't delete to 0 rows</li>
<li>bugfix: synonym search duplicates removed</li>
<li>Development:  Refactored for configuration &amp; adding field. Made the internal code much more generic for adding new fields from configuration, got rid of a lot of hard wiring.&nbsp; Part of this was instituring model-view-controller in some places where views were improperly talking to other views. In theory this should also make it easier to plop a web gui on top of the current phenote model &amp; controller.</li>
<li>Development:  Renamed Phenotype to Character. Added Character interface CharacterI.</li>
<li>Development: Added tests to test suite.</li>

</ul>

<h2>0.3<hr></h2>
04.07.2006, version <a href="0.3/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.3</a>, <a href="0.3.1/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.3.1 (for CToL)</a><br>
<p>Note:  0.3.1 is identical to 0.3 except that it has ontologies for CToL
(fish evolution group). In particular it uses a fish taxonomy<br>
ontology for the id (in this taxonomy) choosing. On the todo is the
ability to configure ontologies, but not there yet, so for now need to
hardwire with seaparate jar file. This clearly makes the todo item a
bit more pressing.</p>
<p>  Release for NESCent fish eveolution meeting. No major new functionality
here. Cleaned up and fixed a lot of the bugs in 0.2, which was rather
buggy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>feature:  Completion terms now sorted alphabeitcally.</li>
  <li>feature:  Obsoletes are now in addition to regular terms, not in lieu of.</li>
  <li>feature:  Filtering out attribute values (todo: change to actually filter in
values)</li>
<li>change:  Html formatting of term info (todo: make terms selectable)</li>
<li>feature:  Children relations are in term info</li>
<li>change:  Term info layout greatly improved</li>
<li>change:  Term info in scroller</li>
<li>change:  Border with label around term info</li>
<li>change:  Put definition at end of term info</li>
<li>bugfix:  Backspace in ontology combo box</li>
<li>bugfix:  Selection of item in comp list causing exception, not going in term box</li>
<li>bugfix:  No terms with just 1 char</li>
<li>bugfix:  Popup was staying up after selection</li>
<li>development:  Test suite added! (todo: add more tests)</li>
<li>development:  Migrated to jdk 1.5 (which caused some of the bugs above)</li>
<li>development:  Ant file made build.xml.</li>
<li>development:  CompletionList refactored into Ontology (prompted by sorting)</li>
</ul>

<h2>0.2<hr></h2>
03.27.2006, version <a href="0.2/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.2</a><br>
<ul>
  <li>feature:  term completion on Synonyms, Definitions and Obsoletes</li>
  <li>feature:  mouse-over on term in completion list displays info in 'term info' text area</li>
<li>Todo:  layout, scrollbar, border w title, ordering &amp; lumping parents
&amp; children, formatting.  Also perhaps have children &amp; parents be clickable in some fashion  either html-like clickable text or as buttons.</li>
<li>known bugs:  If you hit backspace in term completion fields it gets wacky </li>
</ul>
<h2>0.1<hr></h2>
03.01.2006, version <a href="0.1/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.1</a><br>
<p> 0.1 was the initial phenote release (known briefly as the plumper at
the time).  It just had a genotype, anatomy and pato fields, where
anatomy and pato did term completion (just on term names) with there
ontologies in a drop down list. There was also the phenotype table that
tracked phenotype instances being edited in the above fields. This very
limited functionality was demo'd at the cbio meeting 3/3/06 at Stanford.</p>
