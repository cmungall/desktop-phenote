Phenote will merge its default configuration with users configuration,
preserving users changes as well as adding anything new from phenote
upgrade.<br>
User can select configuration they want to use at initialization or
subsequently from file menu &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (currently requires phenote restart).<br>
Tab delimited data adapter - thank you nicole!<br>
Beginnings of term history - thank you nicole!<br>
Tabbed main field panel if more than 12 fields.<br>
QueryableDataAdapter interface for adding a database data adapter that
can be queried. The data adapter specifies queryable fields, which get
a retrieve button.<br>
Layout improved<br>
Can now search ALL ontologies of a field<br>
Retrieve obo from web if more up to date or no local found<br>
Refactored code for field guis<br>
Ontology chooser reflects current term (bug fix)

<br>

The main improvement here is the ability to add any field you like, not
just E,Q,GC,GT,Pub. In the configured webstarts Stage, Evidence,
Description, Abnormal, and Absent have been added through this new
mechanism. This entailed a refactoring of the datamodel.<br>

<br>

Webby phenote is now using JSP and Spring.<br>

<br>

There has been some recent work with UVictoria for ontology graph
visualization. This is coming along well and hopefully will be seen in
the next release.

<br>


Undo<br>


Christian Pich(Zfin) has added a Quartz scheduler to phenote, which
zfin takes advantage of, to schedule when to check for new obo files.<br>


Also Christian Pich upgraded the PhenoteServlet to the Spring framework
- much nicer!<br>


Synonyms are now returned from auto complete with [syn] and when
selected the term goes in the field (webby &amp; standalone), obsoletes
hits with [obs]<br>


Bulk update &amp; copy in standalone.<br>


Jim Balhoff(Nescent) changed radio buttons to checkboxes, and file
saver says save not load and recognizes adapter by file extensions,
psx-&gt;phenosyntax, .xml -&gt; phenoxml <br>


Single quotes escaped for javascript fns.<br>

Added post composition to standalone phenote. Logging for both
webby/servlet &amp; standalone.<br>


Pheno-xml reader (thanks to Jim Balhoff) and improvements to pheno-xml
writer (does pub &amp; genetic context)<br>


Command line reading &amp; writing of phenoxml &amp; phenosyntax.<br>


Application exits on window exit (unless servlet)<br>


Can filter out stage terms from zfin anatomy<br>

Web: entity chooser, can configure to check for new obo files and load
them. (These are installed at zfin, if anyone would like to see them
publicly let me know). Entity field and term info installed into zfin
phenotype site. term info &amp; completion are scrollable.<br>


Standalone: can read &amp; write pheno-syntax with ids &amp; term names
in comments, entity chooser, pub field, use button in term info, sort
table by clicking on headers, personal config file gets copied out of
jar, paste mac bug fixed, file load/save remembered,layout fixed<br>

<br>


The main feature of release 0.6 is a webby phenote. This is in its
extremely early stages (very little functionality and buggy). At this
point it only does Entity and Quality fields and term info and thats
it, and even thats buggy, but more coming soon! <br>


<br>


Not much new in the stand alone phenote (as Ive been working on the
webby phenote). Mainly it can write pheno-xml, and it uses the latest
pato (as of July 28, 2006).<br>

No&nbsp; new additions to the gui here. In preparation for my visit to
Cambridge/FlyBase, I worked on a FlyBase dataadapter. This is phenote
first data adapter so I also laid down the foundations for data
adapters. The FlyBase data adapter simply cuts and pastes phenotype
character objects to the system clipboard. The idea is that FlyBase's
Proforma java application will also cut and paste to the clipboard.
This is a simple way to pass objects between applications, to get us
off the ground.&nbsp; Proforma is not there yet so this has not been
tested yet with Proforma, but it works in the test suite. Added special
FlyBase character wrappers that do the parsing and creating of Proforma
character strings.<br>

4/26/06<br>


Added Genetic Context field.<br>


Parent &amp; child terms in term info are now clickable/navigable.<br>


Links in descriptions are clickable (should bring up default browser)<br>


Added configuration to configure ontologies &amp; fields. This is
currently at a devloper level (xml file) not a user level(gui - todo).
There is a command line argument for which configuration file to use.
This allows for having separate zf &amp; fb releases without having to
change the code to do it (like was done for the ctol release). The
configuration for now is for developers (internal xml file), on the
todo is to have a gui configuration for users.<br>


Minor bugs:&nbsp; cant delete to 0 rows anymore, synonym search
duplicates taken out<br>


<br>


Dev stuff:<br>


Refactored for configuration &amp; adding field. Made the internal code
much more generic for adding new fields from configuration, got rid of
a lot of hard wiring.&nbsp; Part of this was instituring
model-view-controller in some places where views were improperly
talking to other views. In theory this should also make it easier to
plop a web gui on top of the current phenote model &amp; controller.<br>


Renamed Phenotype to Character. Added Character interface CharacterI.<br>


Added tests to test suite.<br>


<br>


<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0.3.1 (CToL)<br>


</span></h2>


<a href="0.3.1/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.3.1 phenote webstart (for CToL)</a><br>


<br>


4/7/06<br>


0.3.1 is identical to 0.3 except that it has ontologies for CToL
(fish evolution group). In particular it uses a fish taxonomy<br>


ontology for the id (in this taxonomy) choosing. On the todo is the
ability to configure ontologies, but not there yet, so for now need to
hardwire with seaparate jar file. This clearly makes the todo item a
bit more pressing.<br>


<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0.3</span></h2>

Release for NESCent fish eveolution meeting. No major new functionality
here. Cleaned up and fixed a lot of the bugs in 0.2, which was rather
buggy.<br>


<br>


Completion terms now sorted alphabeitcally.<br>


Obsolete is now in addition to regular terms, not in lieu of.<br>


Filtering out attribute values (todo: change to actually filter in
values)<br>


Html formatting of term info (todo: make terms selectable)<br>


Children relations are in term info<br>


Term info layout greatly improved<br>


Term info in scroller<br>


Border with label around term info<br>


Put definition at end of term info<br>


<br>


Fixed bugs:<br>


Backspace in ontology combo box<br>


Selection of item in comp list causing exception, not going in term box<br>


No terms with just 1 char<br>


Popup was staying up after selection<br>


<br>


Dev stuff:<br>


Test suite added! (todo: add more tests)<br>


Migrated to jdk 1.5 (which caused some of the bugs above)<br>


Ant file made build.xml.<br>


CompletionList refactored into Ontology (prompted by sorting)<br>


<br>


<br>


<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0.2</span></h2>


<a href="0.2/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.2 phenote webstart</a><br>


<br>


3/27/06<br>


Added the ability to do term completion on Synonyms, Definitions, and
Obsoletes. Also can mouse over a term in a completion list and get
information about it in the term info text area. <br>


<br>


The term info area needs a lot of work.<br>


TODO:<br>


&nbsp;layout, scrollbar, border w title, ordering &amp; lumping parents
&amp; children, formatting. <br>


Also perhaps have children &amp; parents be clickable in some fashion
either html-like clickable text or as buttons.<br>


Theres also bugs in term completion boxes. If you start backspacing it
gets wacky for instance.<br>


<br>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">0.1</span></h2>


<a href="0.1/phenote-webstart.jnlp">0.1 phenote webstart</a><br>


<br>


&nbsp;3/1/06<br>


0.1 was the initial phenote release (known briefly as the plumper at
the time).&nbsp; It just had a genotype, anatomy and pato fields, where
anatomy and pato did term completion (just on term names) with there
ontologies in a drop down list. There was also the phenotype table that
tracked phenotype instances being edited in the above fields. This very
limited functionality was demo'd at the cbio meeting 3/3/06 at Stanford.<br>
