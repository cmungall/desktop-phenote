comment: Anthocyanin is the red to purple pigments composed of soluble glycosides of anthocyanidins\, present in leaves and floral tissue. Usually the pigment is produced under stress conditions. Amounts of anthocyanin produced depend on stored sugar and sunlight. The more stored sugar in the leaf and brighter the autumn days\, the more intense red. Anthocyanin production also increases as phosphates move out of the leaves; the lack of phosphates in young leaves can also lead to the production of anthocyanin.

comment: The worms appear suddenly in masses and move like an army from field to field so that seedbeds or the direct seeded fields look as if grazed by cattles. Generally\, a transplanted crop is not severely affected. Damage by armyworms is most serious during periods of stem elongation and grain formation. Larvae defoliate plants\, typically by chewing angular pieces off leaves. They may also feed on the panicle near the developing kernels causing these kernels to dry before filling. This feeding causes all or parts of the panicle to  turn white. If the entire panicle is white\, the damage may also be due to stem rot or feeding by rats. The  seriousness of armyworm injury depends on the maturity of the plant and the amount of tissue consumed. Significant yield reduction can occur if defoliation is greater than 25% at 2 to 3 weeks before heading. They migrate from field to field and extensive losses are often caused within a week. Their migration is facilitated by the absence of standing water in the field.

comment: Chlorophyll is the principal photoreceptor in photosynthesis\, the light-driven process in which carbon dioxide is fixed to yield carbohydrates and oxygen. Chlorophyll is a cyclic tetrapyrolle\, similar in structure to the heme group of globins (hemoglobin\, myoglobin) and cytochromes. Chlorophyll differs from heme in a few major respects\, most notably that the central metal ion in chlorophyll is magnesium while that in heme is iron.

comment: The method typically uses acidified quaternary detergent solution to dissolve cell solubles\, hemicellulose and soluble minerals leaving a residue of cellulose\, lignin\, and heat damaged protein and a portion of cell wall protein and minerals (ash). Acid detergent fiber is determined gravimetrically as the residue remaining after extraction. The lower the acid detergent fiber\, the more digestible the feed is and the higher the energy value of the feed.

def: "Malformed inflorescence (panicle in rice)\, by staying upright/straight at the time of maturity and may carry infertile seeds." [GR:pj, web:http\://plantpathology.tamu.edu/Texlab/Grains/Rice/rices.html]
comment: For rice\: Straighthead is a physiological disorder that causes the entire head to be blank and remain upright at maturity in rice. Straighthead generally occurs in spots scattered throughout a field and is most easily recognized near harvest when normal plants have downturned heads (from the weight of the grain in the panicle). The disease is frequently found on sandy loam soils but seldom on clay soils. Old cotton fields with arsenic residues can have a severe incidence of straighthead. Other\, as yet unknown\, soil factors are also involved in causing straighthead. Often it is found in fields where excessive non-decayed vegetation has been plowed under just before planting. The disease is characterized by upright heads when the rice matures due to infertile seed. Hulls may be distorted into a crescent shape or \"parrot beak\". One or both hulls may be missing. Affected plants continue to grow\, are a darker green\, and often produce shoots from a lower portion of the plant. First year crops of rice grown on \"new ground\" are more likely to be affected. Some varieties are more tolerant than others. Control measures include planting resistant varieties and draining fields with a history of the disorder just prior to internode elongation.
