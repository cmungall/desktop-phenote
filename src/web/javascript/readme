3 files: dichty-term-info.js ncbo-term-info.js term-completer.js
one sub directory: ajax-lib

ajax-lib is open source ajax code from scriptaculous that the above files use.
in theory these shouldnt need to be modified (though ive had my temptations)

The 3 scripts are all for term info retrieval from the backend. They should 
probably be merged & deleted. The main variant is the back url to get term info
from and that url should come from the top page where all mod specific stuff is set,
rather than here. Once that is done should be able to merge. 

These scripts are called with onMouseOver that is in the completion list that is
returned by the server for autocompletion.

dichty-term-info.js might be old and if so should be deleted? sohel?

term_completer.js is the new dichty base script (or old??).

ncbo-term-info.js 
-----------------
is used for zfin/ncbo. There are some difference to dichty here.
The method is called getTermInfo which is a clearer name then set_ontology or 
set_ontology_term. The url is different and as said above should be set in 
the top mod specific page not here. 

OntologyName & field are passed as
parameters. Ontology name is needed for cases where theres an ontology chooser
(zfin entity - dichty can ignore this). field is needed so the Use Term button
of TermInfo knows which field to update (its the field the original term came from).

In the top level html (ncbo.html) the form with the terms is given the name 
termForm and that is used instead of forms[0] which can be presumptious if plugging
into a mods web page.

The checking of the length of the ontologyid array was scrapped as it was unnecasary.

So these scripts should be merged, and I think the ncbo changes should be incorporated.
Would you agree sohel?
