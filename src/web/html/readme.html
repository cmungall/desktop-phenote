dichty.html: I think this is old and should be deleted - sohel? replaced by interface.html


interface.html:
--------------- 
This should be renamed dichty-top.html as this is dichty base's new
top level html page. The improvement over dichty.html (amongst other additions) is
that it generically creates fields using the Sever Side Includes(SSI) file 
term_completer.html. Also has commit & retrieve buttons, that call javascript functions.

term_completer.html
-------------------
This is generic server side include stuff for interface.html. It takes vars tag, title,
 & url. see interface.html for use. This should be renamed term_completion_field.ssi
 or just field.ssi (are all fields term completion - some may be free text) or
 field_template.ssi?


ncbo.html 
---------
This is the top html page for ncbo/zfin (rename zfin.html?). It should use the new
SSI paradigm and use the term_completer.html SSI stuff. But this does have stuff that
interface/term_completer lacks. That is it has an entity chooser (dichtybase has no
need for one), and a UseTerm button. These require both an ontology name and field
name to be passed into the auto completion function. Also method names are renamed 
for clarity sake. 


So in summary ncbo.html & interface.html need to grab stuff from each other. Both of which
serve as templates for new groups coming up with there own top level page (mod.html)
